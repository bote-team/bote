AT
Shortly after the foundation of the Coalition of Planets, it was decided to commission a new, revolutionary ship class. The result was a platform which enabled mankind to leave their star system and explore the universe. These ships are, despite their relatively strong armament, predominantly research ships and their captains can see that they are not a threat for a real combat vessel.

Barracuda
After introduction to the fleet the Barracuda-class definitely counts as one of the fastest ships of the Coalition. She has bioneural ship computer components and a variable geometric continuum field that is created by special continuum pylons. These ships are small but very agile and persistant.

Duluth
The Duluth-class is the result of an ambitious development program at the Utopia Planitia fleet yards. The huge Duluth-class dwarves everything done before and was mainly designed to replace the antiquated Chilmark and Farscape classes at scientific missions. When drawing the concept of the Duluth-class the best engineers and technicians of the Coalition have worked together and created the doubtlessly most advanced ship in the fleet. Aside from its role on scientific assignments this ship type also is an excellent command ship to coordinate large fleet operations and also is a strong enemy.

Shortly after having forced the Ultima One project, newly-designed components were integrated into the latest small ship class for practical testing purposes. Out of that the ultramodern recon scouts of the Longeye class was designed which from now on replaces the Mole-class. Longeyes are likewise considerably more compact and durable than their predecessors which makes conducting scientific activities even under worst conditions possible.

Matilda
The Matilda-class originally was an experimental prototype of more modern cruisers. Yet the ship impressed the engineers and crew members so much that it has been added to the fleet. Engines, weapons, armor as well as shields are extraordinarily good. It can take over all imaginable tasks. At present there is hardly any ship out there which is able to hold a candle to the Matilda-class. One disadvantage however is the high build costs.

Patton
Pattons are heavily armed and very agile. The Patton class owes its existence to the increased efforts of the Coalition fleet to avert potential danger from large enemy vessels. For this reason torpedo armament is especially distinct. As a sideline state-of-the-art defensive systems were integrated in this ship class. Enemy ships will have a hard time pitting themselves against a fleet of Pattons.

The Wolf-class is replacing the not-so-old Benton-class. The prominent advantage of this ship is the relatively low production costs. Also the ship offers excellent speed and maneuverability in combat. Hardly any other ship can keep up with that. On the bad side are the relatively few offensive weapons.

Glantor-class transports are designed to follow combat vessels into enemy territory, carrying troops for ground invasion. Since these ships do not carry any ship-to-ship weapons, it is prudent to keep escorts attached to those ships.

HanQuhr
The HanQuhr is the flagship of the Heyoun Trade Union and therefore the most advanced and dangerous ship in the fleet. Earlier concerns about the non-profitability of such monstrous and expensive ship classes were dismissed after several unfavorable battles against enemy large warships of this size and soon this gorgeous ship was born. All ship systems, especially the weapons are state-of-the art.

Vantor
Originally drafted as a small short-range freighter, this ship was equipped with a variety of smaller weapon systems and upgraded with better shields. These improvements were necessary since other unarmed transporters often fell victim to pirate attacks an other enemy privateers. The current version of the Vantor has dropped its transporter role and is now used for front-line patrol missions, as escort and for fast raids.

Fear
Fear-class transporters carry freight or invasion troops through the Empire. Its role as a troop transporter makes it very valuable for the Khaoron which is why it was equipped with a disruptor cannon to defend itself. However it does not necessarily protect the ship from any enemy ship or orbital batterynbecause of the ship's low speed and weak shields.

High speed and good sensors contribute to its special dangerousness. The only weak spot - if it could be called that - is the shields, therefore the Leviathan is extremely  strong armored.

C'labrum
In its tireless efforts to expand territorial borders, the Rotharian Star Network is continually colonizing new planets. Ships like the C'labrum transport colonists and equipment to these worlds for terraforming and construction of a local infrastructure. Thereby the ship itself serves as source for building material once the planets are reached. Like all colony ships this model is also unarmed and terribly slow so that it is defenseless against attacks.

D'Ocellus
The D'Ocellus-class battle colossus is double the size of a Coalition Duluth-class cruiser with a slight advantage in firepower at comparable speeds and maneuverability but weaker shields and sensors. This disadvantage is well-compensated however by its powerful cloak which gives this colossus the chance to surprise and attack enemy ships that are even stronger and better-shielded before they can raise their shields. An attacking squadron of D'Ocellus battleships that approaches under the cover of its cloak, can take out nearly every opponent including star bases and large fleets at first strike or at least heavily damage them.

M'adomen
M'adomen-class fighters are extremely nimble ships that are best used in large squadrons where they can deliver terrible damage to the enemy. With their high speed, impulse distruptors, a good cloak and relatively strong shields, such an attack formation can have devastating effects on other fleets or even bases that are surprised by it. Swarms of M'adomens encircle enemy cruisers and eliminate them with concentrated fire, while they themselves are hard to hit.

M'esothirax
An early Rotharian model of a small nimble fighting ship that is preferably used in large squadrons to destroy larger ships through combined firepower from all sides and break up enemy formations. They can also often be seen as escorts for freighter convoys or battleships. Furthermore they are also used to intercept enemy scouts, which they are mostly clearly superior to with regards to maneuverability, shields and armament.

The M'etathaurax-class is the successor of the M'esothirax-fighter. This small, extremely agile fighting ship is particularly used in big squadrons to disrupt bigger ships through combined firepower from all sides and break up enemy formations. Also it serves as an escort ship and is also used to intercept enemy scouts, a task, which this ship excels at usually. A smart fleet admiral utilizes these ships to weaken enemy fleets before his main strike force engages in battle.

Despite its low speed and only moderate firepower these ships are well suited for espionage missions and covert reconnaissance, due to their maneuverability and especially because of their cloaking device.

Should they be detected despite their excellent cloaking and caught by a warship, they could easily escape with maximum speed. Smaller enemies do not have a chance against its impulse disruptors.

R'Acron
R'Acron cruisers are heavy assault ships that can fire devastating broadsides onto enemy ships or planetary bombardments with their disruptors and torpedos. Rotharian commanders indeed prefer tactics and finesse, but this ship could also withstand a serious engagement with a respective enemy. Its relatively weak shields are compensated by good cloaking and a powerful engine. R'Acron-class cruisers were the backbone of the Rotharian Strike Force for a long time and enjoyed great popularity with their commanders.

V'Tarsomer
Another model of the Rotharian battle colossus series. The V'Tarsomer is a nimble and fast cruiser that offers only a flat target to its opponents and can outmaneuvre enemy ships. Its strong armament with impulse disruptors and the excellent cloaking device makes it ideal for pushes into enemy territory as simultaneously intruding ships are not given many escape possibilities. This ship definitely marks a further highlight of Rotharian ship building and is well-liked among its crew.

Its strong armament consisting of disruptors and torpedo bays make this fighting ship together with its high speed and cloaking a more than worthy opponent for every other enemy cruiser. Additionally this ship can be successfully used as a command ship for fleet operations.

V'tarsus
This class of advanced, highly modern destroyers serves as the fast response ship of the Star Network. Its extreme speed and high maneuverability in combination with its relatively strong impulse disruptors makes it a deadly opponent for ships of a similar size. Aside from that the ship is perfect for quick raids deep in the enemy territory, whereby it is often deployed in small squadrons to surprise and destroy single larger ships or even outposts by their combined firepower.

The Vi founded this orbital station a long time ago and continuously increased its size and weaponry as a symbol of their power over the universe visible to each citizen on the planet's surface, also as a pilgrimage site. Recently its hull was upgraded with a material the Vi called "a gift from the gods" which promises extreme durability and protection against enemy fire since it had survived unscratched the downfall on the planet's surface inside the comet.

Kryonit Entity
Kryonit is a supraconducting material which these entities seem to consist of. It allows high-energetic shieldbreaking discharges and guarantees for an excellent shielding against all kinds of weapons. Its hull is relatively weak but it can extract external hull energy for its own shields. Kryonit is usually unstable and technologies to use it have not been found yet.
