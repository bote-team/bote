ADAMAR:
Adamen
Adamen are obstinate traders who have a stately arsenal of effective ship classes. Their ambitious youth are trained from an early age in all aspects of ship trade and fleet management. Every self-respecting Adamen aspires to own a full ship hangar and an equally-full order book. It is not only about pure transport and delivery however, but also about escort and protection of foreign transport fleets for cash or an interest in the protected product. The Adamen are almost like deputy sheriffs in the quadrant, with the exception that one can usually bet one's life on their help. This excellent reputation precedes them with nearly all races. Our support for this successful education should gather a lot of sympathy among them.

ADRYL:
Adryl
Adryl are hospitable nomads living on a large planet. They are not accustomed to conflict yet they carry elegant armaments made from the antlers and leather of game as deterrence and protection against wild animals. Every now and then, they hold a planet-wide ritual to bring the mystic divinities of the sea, the animals, and the arable land to harmony. These underwater fights against certain sea animals are strenuous and dangerous as well as pointless. However, they are repeated until the chosen matador brings one of the numerous sea animals with more than double his weight ashore. Then the new master kills the beast ceremonially and must distribute its entrails himself in several hard day's marches to different places, whose exact locations are computed through astonishingly complicated calculations, and bury them there. On such blessed ground, the harvest will be especially rich according to the beliefs of the Adryl. It draws mostly the young Adryl to these places and they settle and farm the land with great vigour.

AIHLINN:
Aihlinn
The society of the Aihlinn is purely functional and completely predestined. Regularly in late autumn new Liahninn mature in brood chambers at the various foetus plantations. All plantations specialize in certain breeds and optimize them for the development of either strong workers, craftsmen, warriors or farmers, but also engineers for the servicing of the brood devices there. No special attention is paid to the development of a distinctive intellect. Well-behaved servants ensure that the system is run correctly. There is no higher government and also no historical documents which can example how this situation came about. Up to now, the masses of the Aihlinn have submitted to their odd role as grown servants. However, there are increasing signs that they are starting to develop bit by bit a consciousness for themselves. The construction of basic general educational institutions could help them with this development.

ALDARI:
Aldren
Aldren live their whole lives in a liquid medium. Their obvious artificial origin is unaccounted for, but their creators must have been true masters of carbon engineering. An Aldar can survive for aeons in the endless seas of his planet. Their carbon molecular chains cannot be cracked either by the nature or by light lasers. Only heavy exact spin-inverted anti-matter lasers are able to break through the skin of the Aldren. They were apparently not programmed to fight and kill, and their only aim seems to be self-preservation and the investigation of ingenious protective mechanisms, such as a solid planet-surface armor, which needs a large amount of steadily supplied energy to stand firm against the strong tidal forces of the four moons surrounding the planet.

ALEMNI:
Alemnians
Scientific progress is the main trait of the Alemnian culture. They mostly investigate foreign cultures covertly from a distance and try to collect all their freely available knowledge. They are especially delighted if they can catch an already extinct race which they dissect with meticulous and devoted accuracy. They collect everything. Every common object, every single common room is preserved, dug up and displayed in larger-than-life exhibition halls on their planet. Alemnians love to live in authentic duplicates of these foreign worlds and surroundings of other races.  That is to say that wealthy Alemnians make themselves at home in those halls and relive the preserved life of old cultures. The hunger for new discoveries consumes most of the surplus resources on their planet and in their zeal to obtain foreign things, some interesting knowledge about otherwise usually long-lost tools and anatomies of forgotten species gather through time which are then scientifically examinable.

ALEUB:
Aleubites
Aleubites were suppressed by the Mozwar and brutally exploited for a long time. We must decide on which side to support if we do not want to lose both races to others or leave them both to their destiny. With diplomatic restraint we will achieve nothing at all, because the Aleubites already admitted that they wish for a quick decision, because with every passing day, there are more victims on their side. The underground war has cost them dearly. For a long time now every progress and every normal social growth has been put on ice. Many Aleubites are also starved to the edge of exhaustion. Nevertheless, the Aleubites know how to defend themselves efficiently. Their strike power and surgical precision in those small attacks against the Mozwar has already caused many victims. The degree of organization within the resistance is exceptional. Aleubites are said to be reliable and well-trained combatants, they are not a people to be messed with.

ANDROMEDA:
Andromedans
Andromedans are a warlike people with a bloody past. The cruelties of the wars between Andromeda and Deshant are still particularly fresh in everyone's mind. However they have deep faith in a peaceful future. This is founded on their willingness to form expedient relations with other races. Their will to conquer can develop very strongly, yet only if they really set their mind on something. Otherwise a rather defensive style characterizes them. After the end of the second Andromedan-Deshant war the remnant fleets formed a movable wide phalanx around their territory where fleet exercises are constantly held. The necessity for these drills arose since the fleets at the beginning of the second war were wiped out in disastrous battles, because no one took the time for a deep analysis of the first war in which they were successful. The Andromedans won't make this mistake ever again.

ANGOLIA:
Angoliths
Angolia's sparse steppes are the location of a fascinating humanoid race which is about to realize the dream of skintight protective body energy shields. After depositing bio-compatible Duranium alloys onto the skin, the glowing shield lasts for up to one skin regeneration cycle. This procedure is extremely painful and can also be extremely dangerous at times, but this does not discourage a true Angolian warrior in the slightest. They fight purely on a voluntary basis. The rest of their society is whole-heartedly pacifistic and would not undergo such a barbarian procedure. However, for the sake of military capability this practice is tolerated particularly because it has already influenced several wars in favor of the Angoliths. The investigation of the biogenic compatibility of this method might turn out to be advantageous for our research.

Every prominent member of their wide-branched university networks and impulse research institutes receives an invitation for admission into the Astronaut's Guild where research under optimal conditions is possible. Ankarans cannot stand gossipers. Their ships have an impressive speed. The highest guild member is determined largely by the numerous circles of fighter pilots who enjoy a special position in the constitutional system of the state. The guild's chairperson may freely make decisions about war and peace, however he can be outvoted, by a 3/4 majority in the guild committee in secret ballots.

ANTROMEL:
Antromel
Antromel are a mechanoid race developed by the Yaroborte. Originally the Yaroborte built the Antromel to do their housework and production work to make life easier for the Phiori who were their masters. After the Yaroborte seized power and full control over the planet Yarobor and re-settled the Phiori, the Antromel were no longer needed. They were forgotten and many were scrapped. The few who survived those times developed through time an emotional chip which transformed them into perfect living beings. After some major uprisings even the Yaroborte could no longer deny the development the Antromel had undergone and also re-settled them into a new system. There they were left with only the most basic tools necessary to survive. Nevertheless they were free and able to reproduce themselves from now on and further develop their own consciousness.

AQINDOAN:
Aqindoan
Aqindoan are a race which is characterized by the horrors of endless wars. After centuries of constant warfare among themselves, peace was a macabre occasion, because it came about through the eradication of all rivaling factions on the planet. In the course of the war very advanced biomechanical experiments were carried out to allow the Aquindoan to get by without skin which is easily ignitable and live only with the skeleton. This resulted in the decisive victory for the 13th faction of the Aqindoan. When they found out that all system resources were used up already, they planned and conducted their first large space travel activities. Not long after that, they discovered the neighbouring Scytorians whose responsible raw material handling seemed moronic to them. After a violent first contact the Scytorians conducted a disastrous preventative strike against the Aqindoan home world and since that time, both peoples are engaged in a relentless, almost epic war.

ARCASA:
Arcasans
Arcasans are a light membranous humanoid race which spends their whole lives in temporal stasis. Every Arcasan is surrounded by nature in a temporal capsule. For outside observers they seem to move in slow motion and remind them rather of statues than of living beings. However, within the stasis field, time passes quite normally. With this strange quality, Arcasans can become more than 10,000 years old. However, in their time field they do not become much older than 50 years. Any communication with the Arcasans is complicated by the stasis field equations and an answer often needs a very long time to arrive. It is advisable to formulate short and succinct sentences. Their culture deals with literature, poetry and other philosophical things. We can still learn a lot from their knowledge, culture and ease of mind, however, in order to accomplish that we should develop an adequate, time delayed and independent communication channel.

ARDOR:
Ardren
Ardren are cosmic relatives of the Aldren and have been able to escape from their artificial counterparts and found their own colony. Technologically they are not particularly advanced, but therefore are substantially more trusting and more curious, they also have the same weakness for energy and every aspect of its creation. Their capable science departments have dealt successfully with the sub-string theory and use broken-dimensional movements of the matter anti-matter reaction to generate fractal energy patterns which can reproduce almost inexhaustibly and deliver an abundant source of energy. Their only problem is how to protect the anti-matter chambers against diffusion effects, which is why this type of technology was designated as too dangerous by our scientific departments. Nevertheless, the Ardren themselves are keen each time these fractals cause new patterns on their computers. These fractal beings are looked upon as their creators, that's why Aldren react very angrily to closer investigation of their creatures.

ASZRETH:
Aszrethans
Aszrethans are a naturally aggressive and guarded people. Planetary government ranks are displayed by colored facial visors. Novices have green ones; turquoise blue for normal functionaries; those wearing yellow are leading officials and white is worn by the prelate of the government. It is not unusual for women to be in this leading position, because they can manage and stomach this difficult profession best of all. The life of a prelate is particularly difficult as they must not show any kind of weakness and must renounce their family completely to remain as incorruptible as possible for their own protection. They must acquire a new identity like in a witness protection program. Maybe it is due to this common state of mistrust that the obvious bitterness among people does not disappear in their very advanced society. The mostly brutal show fights in the arenas, created as a distraction originally, are always crammed.

ATHARI:
Athari
Atharians are particularly distinguished for their engineer's art and love for detail in the matter of computer engineering. Outwardly they appear rather insignificant but neat, the Athari usually deal with the physical nature of sub-quark atomic levels and the control of the Heisenberg exceptions in this area which are examined in expensive test rows in labs distributed across the whole planet. On account of their proverbial diligence the Athari have developed elegant methods to realize computers on ever smaller dimension scales and have been able to raise the speed and versatility of computers significantly. A new computer test arrangement often excites them so much that they can easily forget everything else. However they aren't able to deal with secretive beings and view them with distrust. They have created a database about every race they know and only a few bytes on certain races is seen as a sign of weakness.

AZORA:

Azoras shipyards are the pride of the whole planetary system. Over an area of around 200,000 kilometres a breathtaking arrangement spans the stars which outshines everything our engineers managed to build up to now. In more than 3,000 lunar-size halls more than 4 billion robots, engineers and planners potter around the gigantic ships of the Azorans which can easily carry ten times the net tonnage of one of our transporters and not be much different in agility and speed. The Azorans build only transporters, no other ships, which has earned them the nickname 'space truckers'. However, they do not let others mess with their planning, as they are very conceited. Despite this, we must obtain this facility! The construction of top-class ships in the shortest time can be realised without big expenditure.

B'WAR:
B'war
B'war are a peculiar race. Although they are only a few millimeters in size and strongly reminiscent of amoebas, they are very aggressive and do not tolerate strangers. Because of their physical disadvantage in combat, they have developed gigantic machines, so-called Mechs. In each case two B'war sit directly behind both 'eyes' of a Mech and steer this battle colossus. Due to their permanent destructive wars they are the only organic life form on their home planet. Even bacteria and viruses were exterminated entirely with the help of nano-Mechs. A B'war itself needs very little food, rest or sleep. They strive their whole lives for armed conflict. However, B'war never fight each other. To be able to reach these goals, they own impressive production facilities for the construction of countless Mechs. Should we succeed in impressing this xenophobic race, those production plants will fall into our hands and most likely will help us in producing complex machines.

However, once persuaded in long time-consuming negotiations, a Ba'a can quickly learn to work with new tools and weapons, and can offer themselves for the service of peace-keeping with their allies. They are firmly convinced that they have to use all means necessary in order to ensure peace, even die for it. They detest wars in general yet know how to prevent them in their own special way and through their understanding of pacifism. A Ba'a loves the imposing presentation of glowing armaments. They are determined to die for their native country if it is necessary. Their willingness to staff the most dangerous posts within the army voluntarily appeals to reassures the population of their allies. However, they are no more effective than normal troops in battle which is largely because of their primitive origin.

Baflides are small ingenious imps. Their unarmed appearance is founded through their ruthless and effective diplomatic skill. They have developed on a mostly hospitable but dangerous world. They have the ability to confuse their counterparts by using their biggest weakness, often a phobia or something simlar, through telepathic projections.  This can occasionally drive them even to insanity. Their harmless appearance is only a projection. Other creatures are instinctively protective of the Baflides, unless they are warlike of nature. Baflides can stand an amount of fun, they don't take anything very seriously and are friendly and curious. In spite of their seemingly naive appearance, Baflides are very intelligent and attentive. This species survived on their planet because of their precise knowledge of the settings and interests of other cultures.

BANDOLERI:

Bandoleri are slightly devious and always have an ace up their sleeves.  They can be found almost everywhere. Psychologically Bandoleri have a calming effect on others. Their movable ears always convey an extreme politeness up to subjugation whereas their not very inviting nose will cause problems for one's wallet. Many cheated and former trading partners indulge in the legend that the formerly long noses of their forefathers had been cut off by offended Kryorans and afterwards completely genetically removed. There are nevertheless still enough simple-minded fools in the galaxy who fall for their gimmicks. Bandoler owns a large commercial register in which all ex-partners who became abusive are listed together with the earned profit from each. This register is not to avoid future damage to other Bandoleri but to display the fame of a Bandoleri and the stupidity of other races. They do not like to publish the precise data however, because they would reveal their nefarious tricks.

CEREG-BARACH:

The tribes of the Bao'begach live on the icy coasts of Gelech-kor. Bao'begach catch one's eye as their small body is coated with a stone-like skin. Their arms have developed as long fins carrying a single thorn at the end. With these fins they can move very quickly under water. The life of a Bar'begach circles around the ice on which they live and under which they go hunting. The ice holes which are punched in a big ceremony at the beginning of spring season have a special meaning for them. As an entrance to their hunting grounds, they have become the symbol for life. Bao'begach are very sociable and playful. They love stories and music. They can sing melodies that are audible a long distance away because of the echoes both above water and underwater. There is a high quality artistic linguistic code that they have developed for millennia now and which many perceive to be a nice melodic song. Technologically, they are remarkably far advanced despite their rather unimposing appearance.

BAON:

In there local language the name Baon means 'strong runner'. A quick look at them is enough to realise why they are called this. Their body is long, and they can move quickly on their hands and legs.  They are also very tough and hardy. Gender-specific differences play no role for most of the year and gender is almost unable to be distinguished externally. However, at times in the year they enter the mating season and a certain wildness and desire erupts in their otherwise stoic character. They feel that the mating desire is unpleasant and they are glad when this uncivilized moodiness is over again and can form platonic trading partnerships again. The Baon are peaceful beings, almost free from angry and crude moods. Their longing to flee often arises when they are panicked. As good-natured people they are used to the decision making processes in society.  These procedures often involve collective votes. A single Baon is however particularly weak at decision-making on an individual basis.

BELAMAR:
Belamar
Belamars are modern monarchs. Their queen uses complicated pheromone signals to control her drone-like citizens in such a way as she deems right. This takes place in several steps through a complex administrative system all around her planetwide kingdom. Financially, the monarchy is supported by large violet gleaming grazite deposits whose high stability is rated in processing. Likewise the highly intoxicating effect of grazite on organisms in its powder form is unique. This grazite is worth its weight in gold in other regions. The Belamar are aware of this, yet they do not offer a lot of their nearly inexhaustible resources to others. They fear those who can develop addictions resulting in an uncontrolled desire that could lead to conquest.  Even if we are able to convince the queen to issue an intermittent suspension decree, a lot of energy and pheromones will be necessary to control the population.

BENT:
Bentans
Bentans attract attention because of their athletic and well-trained physique. At second glance one can see the powerful technology existing in the background. The Bentans possess an unusual evolutionary quirk: Their DNA is dynamic, so that the changes in their bodies are stored genetically and are inherited into their children. Thus, having children from a certain age on is considered unacceptable, because illnesses and missing teeth or limbs are inherited too. Likewise, healthy, physically strong parents will have children with strong bones, well-developed musculature and a strong immune system. As devoted as the Bentans are to their physical exercises, strenuous thinking is left to their proficient computers which were a gift from the befriended Sjapamarain, when they were still at the peak of their power. Because strength and smooth processing are important to them, they had asked the Sjapamarain to program the computers to be self-servicing, so that they did not need extra work in order to maintain them.

In their eyes, only the Berut genuinely follow Gwendescha's example  and carry out the rituals of pure acts with stoic devotion. They are beings obsessed with light-patterns and were already very intelligent at the beginning of their evolution. Their frustration when being constantly attacked at that time yet without sight in open terrain by pterodactyls showed them the way later on for the use of their concealed telekinetic possibilities. Nobody knows when a Berut shot one of his torturers out of the sky for the first time using their telekinesis. Nowadays, the Berut have the frightening ability to move objects with their willpower. Several Berut can combine this talent to achieve a bigger effect. The Berut believe Gwendescha gives them the power to teleport objects and to transmit thoughts to receive more offerings. They occasionally teleport enemies to her up in the sky to maintain harmony with their God.

BITORIA:

Always buried in deep thoughts Bitorians present themselves to foreign cultures as enigmatic. It seems suitable to practice some constraint at the beginning and not disturb them too much. However, once a foothold has been gained with them and knowing their most pressing needs, they are easy influenced. Actually, Bitoria lacks everything, water, enough agricultural areas, diversion and  regulated co-operation. Every Bitorian prefers to remain secluded and to spend their scanty mealtimes in the sole companionship of their own thoughts. They live rather long lives: often 300 years. The biggest fascination for a Bitorian are the graviton sources which were recently discovered in some black holes around Bitoria. They urgently need a stable space science station for further investigation of these phenomena in their system. However, everything they have built up till now has crashed due to carelessness and lack of maintenance. They are easily persuaded that one can offer them better support than other races.

BONERUS:

The bank of Bonerus is one of the most well-financed facilities throughout the galaxy. Bonerian comm systems are very popular among traders since their additional frequencies ensure fast and secure option trading among all members. Being one of those members would bring us additional income. Bonerans are not friendly bosses, but they are nonetheless very careful about their enterprises where private enrichment comes second. Obtaining admission to their multi-planetarian trading partnership may not be difficult for us, because they always value size and prosperity of commercial areas and do not have moral compasses. Aggressive exploitation is abhorrent to them. Numerous stations lie on each of their commercial routes with some kind of space toll. Bonerus is a very successful system, as one can clearly see in the wealth of the Bonerans.

BOSNIC:
Bosniacs
From the ancient tradition of mining on Bosnic a colorful racial mixture has developed. This was inspired by the dream of becoming rich by digging deritium on the planet. When that material was used some hundred years ago in the galaxy for the first time as star engine fuel, the hour of the Bosniacs arrived or rather the melting pot called Bosniacs which stormed the rich beds of the mountain world Bosnic in droves and mined it. Today one finds only isolated veins of Deritium in the thin conventionally minable crust layer below surface in comparison to former times, however, deeper below, there are still further layer extensions, but in a molten liquid state. Mining is difficult and slow while the processing is more dangerous and expensive, which is why the big run is over. Nevertheless the old syndicate connections to the interstellar transportation companies still work and can gain us commercial traffic at a discount.

Created countless millennia ago by people which they themselves only refer to as the "Forgotten" the Bothasiori are what they always were: shape-morphing beings which hire themselves out as mercenaries, spies, infiltrators and assassins. It is nearly impossible to assign a "true" form to a Bothasiori. To relax they likely take a roughly humanoid form and they hardly undergo the troubles to copy all organs faithfully. Besides, quite often they show a sadistic predilection for black humor. Their morphing ability enables them to strengthen their skin and to shift around all body proportions almost arbitrarily. They posess a supreme durability and protection against heat, cold and injury, as well as a distinctive sensory perception. Their "eyes" perceive radiation of every kind and in every spectrum. Bothasiori are to be found everywhere in the quadrant, often camouflaged as locals. Their precise number is unknown, also no one knows anything about their culture.

Brac
Bracs were struck by a disastrous biological weapon of mass destruction and are already in their second generation after the destruction of their old world. Every Brac is covered with distorted masses all over their bodies and the external cell layers of all organs have dissolved to a great extent. In direct sunlight a Brac can survive no longer than a day, only at night it is safe for them to go out.  Therefore, they can only do their work covered in thick woolen cloths like mummies. An uncovered Brac is often already a dead Brac. Their mining abilities were progressive before the incident and so they ensured their survival in the numerous cave systems and shafts which were already dug long before. Indeed, their technological level may have been stagnant for 1 or 2 centuries now, however, it is still competent. They depend on outside help to alleviate their severe condition.  However, they do not trust aggressive people from their own experience.

The Brane carry special energy-shield armour which protect them against the unbearable conditions on other planets and absorb at the same time the strong Duranit oscillations. For they need an extremely high density of nitrogen in the atmosphere to survive. The Brane are masters of cold and calculating strategy. Their Molarit helmet deflects telepathic influences. We must be careful and extremely watchful, as the Brane are no diplomats, but acrimonious fighters.

Their tribal history goes back to the beginnings of their evolution and was not broken through since that time in terms of linearity. It may lie with the clever restraint and balance posture of her inhabitants that destructive wars and conflicts never broke out between the major cities of their planet. Although their civilisation is technologically outdated, their caravan-like trade routes reach far into the depths of the quadrant. One appreciates their neutrality and enjoys rare goods these often long treks inevitably bring from their starting planet, but also from the numerous trading posts on the way. Bretarians usually have everything at hand to offer whereas much are just worthless trinkets.

A biocompatible link interface is implanted in children at birth in the brain cavity which then merges during the early stages of child development with the brain through hormonally induced nerve fiber growth which then permits a direct connection between the Bytolian brain and the computer chip. Primarily the majority of the Bytolians uses this ability for simple communication. Nevertheless, a not insignificant part puts their brain's computing power at the service of computer research within the so-called distributed cerebral high-capacity net of the predominant state universities. Unfortunately, Bytolians hardly have any other interest than computers, therefore we cannot inspire their brains for other valuable research fields such as weapon research or construction engineering.

CAIN:
Cains
Cains are purely telepathic humanoid people. Their history is complicated. On account of the only fragmentary communication via thoughts with them only single puzzle parts are known of it. Only a short time ago it must have taken place. Cousins in black space, presumably some kind of colony, must have recently been destroyed and it looks as if the Cains blame themselves for what happened. The transferred thought-"videos" are incomplete, however, we could recognize that a yet unknown ship has destroyed the pertaining planet completely. The Cains must have seen the danger in advance, however, had no contact with them for a long time because of now quite irrelevant quarrels thus could not reach them any more on time to give a warning. It must have also been reported too late to the responsible authorities on Cain, which is why a new legislation came into force which allows the storage of thoughts in stock. They are already because of their complex communication methods hard to influence.

CALLANEC:
Callanec
Callanecs are a relatively calm, very human race which is known primarily because of their love for research. Contacts with foreign races are faced openly, mainly because they can thereby extend their knowledge base. However, research results do not serve profit, but own technological improvement and advancement. Also trade pursues no monetary purposes, merely the seizure of raw material supply for their institutes. On a personal side however it stirs the Callanec to master difficult situations diplomatically. They also own a distinctive social life and even have plural marriages. So despicably that may sound for most cultures, it is simply owed of the fact that a typical Callanec remains no longer than 2 years at one place and the ways of married people do not likely cross again on account of foreign, vast research. From this hardship and in order to still maintain old connections and relations a marriage was defined to be repetitive and not divorceable. Callanec are prudent in signing contracts with other species to avoid an interference with their own researches and science.

CANOVEK:
Canovek
Canoveks are in spite of their imposing, bear-like appearance agile and nimble mavericks with very distinctive edge and rice teeth which still come from their time as predators in the icy but mineral-bearing marsh of the northern polar highlands. Old prey rituals against immense protozoan beasts, the Elari, on their planet are carried out even today by young Candears, candidates for the uppermost hunter's caste. In family-wide, celebrated hunting competitions splendid marsh villages are constructed for all Elari slayers which they may inhabit with her families and old tribal comrades. Unfortunately, their species show no ambitions for technological progress, why they are interesting for outsiders virtually only because of their great readiness to work and their extensive resources. To win them as a partner however is on account of their aggressive, unimpressed hostility towards foreign "challengers" a very difficult task!

CHAMORA:
Chamorer
Chamorer are a violent and aggressive race, hence one should approach them carefully and with the biggest respect. They're extremely wild and their whole life is characterized by constant fight. The political system on Chamora is supremely anarchic. Mighty Chamorer may gain power about a certain region, but their power is based on personal strength, not diplomatic talent. Strong Chamorer are often murdered by relentless enemies or by ambitious subordinates in order for them to take the respective positions. Chamorer fight exclusively with medieval weapons by which disputes almost always end fatally and bloody. An enemy counts dead only after chopping off his head and limbs. On Chamora men are are more often born than women, because these are more suitable for the hard fights in their world. Nevertheless, the population consists half of women, because no male Chamorer lives long beyond youth.

CHEWARK:
Chewark
Chewarks are lanky determined researchers and explorers. Their society is laid out on law and order structures and functions throught strict observance of the same. They are fascinated by physical phenomena and of course naturally orderly configurations in the universe and produce brilliant engineers and fleet captains. Their physical constitution and psyche is somewhat different to ours. Stress and loud orders increase their ability to think instead of reducing them to dull carrying-out of orders. A Chewark starts to show initiative properly only when he is virtually shouted at. This is mostly very bewildering to outsiders and often misinterpreted as barbarian behavior. On the contrary, on barbarity or warlike actions stands death in Chewark. Without a certain necessary level of background noise one hardly has joy with the Chewark. The average intellect of their population is impressive. In their planetary system the Chewark discovered lots of fallow Deritium in the past which they used for a huge number of ship construction experiments. Their shipyards are the fastest within the quadrant.

CORVELLIA:
Corvellians
The Corvellians are a technologically underdeveloped, neutral trading race. They escaped from the yoke of money and since that time pursue the ancient tradition of barter. The so-acquired goods are put into ship construction which could use indeed a basic modernization, but churns out small vessels in unpreceded speed. One does not account this easily to this race which appeals unfriendly and rather introverted. Seems to be the bees and ants principle which one can also admire at the construction of her ships. The smaller ships are also often ordered by pirates and have high popularity throughout the universe. One thing Corvellians have been given by nature nevertheless and that is no corruptibility in price bargaining. It is paid in kind and no iota less than bargained. Should we attain the control of their shipyards and commercial routes sometime, we will certainly be able to turn any surplus profits into real money.

DELARI:
Delarians
Delarians are guards of an old culture. Settled long ago by an extinct race to the Delari system, they forgot their origin, but not their task to preserve the remains of this civilisation and to protect it from enemies. Their weapons arsenal may host ancient names yet some conquerors already had to bow to the effectiveness of anti-proton arrows and ion slings. They are fed up, however, with sitting on the same old planet for that long time now and hence built their own ships recently to get to know other cultures and to protect them perhaps, for Delarians are best to do just that. They are very open-minded towards others, indeed, yet not towards potential looters and dishonourable exploiters. With them on our side many internal problems might come to an end, in management issues as well as in terms of personal protection.

DERIT:
Deritians
Grown up in a homogeneous society the only choice incumbent upon every single Deritian after majority is between 5 years of conscription or a 10-year fleet duty. Education and drill are hard, but fulfil all standards of modern warfare tactics and could be a beneficial for our military personnel too. On an area of more than 100,000 square kilometres around the poles, exercises under heaviest orbital fire are held constantly, every now and then also with sharp ammunition. Deritian tactics and rules of engagement are long-tested and testifie of big experience. What's most impressive to them is a race which completely gets by without the need to make war. Up till now they only could dream of such things however. Despite all these military drills the desire for unnecessary fighting or even for expansionistic conquests has passed away after so many years of constant ordeal for almost everyone.

DESHANT:
Deshant
The Deshant are fierce and proud warriors who in spite of advanced space technology they possess, still lay a very big value on the skills of Dasha, a traditional art of war back from the Prehtawak age, when astronautics were still a long way off and all Deshant were farmers and carpenters. The Dasha teaches unity of body and scythe and allowed the early farmers back then to pass over to a trance-like state in which they could harvest through day and night without any pause. The crop was available to reap only for a few weeks throughout the year due to recurrent volcano eruptions and lava streams burying all acricultural soils before the beginning of the season of Keld'avam, the endless dryness which inevitably follows the destruction of all fields by wide yearly-returning lava covers. They owe their survival only to this technique and still today use them to prepare for fight and to strengthen their battle morale. Inoptimized handles or flawed sequences are not tolerated by the Deshant, accordingly their ships are also constantly examined up to smallest unit and checked on fail-safe performance.

DOUGTAEK:

Dougtaeks originated in a world full of aggressions and competing beings. They themselves are not first-handedly aggressive and survived by using hiding and observing tactics. Their HUD-interface-enhanced eye-sight encloses a wide light-wave spectrum, so they know very well about their immediate surroundings. They move very fast and their flexible slight bodies easily fit behind every hiding place and allow for good cover during their raids. Their history is of full fights for market-dominating technological achievements and monopolies. Their natural abilities and love for technologically-advanced equipment makes them brilliant thieves in the research area. Other things do not interest them much. Almost all their knowledge is stolen. Dougtaeks are preferrably found in prisons in the quadrant.

To call the Drizzi boozehounds or something like that would perhaps be exaggerated. Their customers are, well, almost always. The typical inventory of a Drizzi consists of all kinds of alcohol, all kinds of cloths and materials and sometimes also antiques, provided that they got no other payment from customers. They produce their own ships which they have puzzled together from all kinds of construction plans of other races' ship classes, because in a sober state the Drizzi are astonishingly deft and able to carry out complex ultrafine-mechanical works with hand-controlled special devices. The advantage compared to automatic production is the economical use of the whole population for these purposes, because every Drizzi is employed either in a special manufacture or possesses even his own. Alcohol trade has got the Drizzi considerable trade connections to a huge number of costumers who we should call asap.

DROGLITH:
Droglith
With theirs barky leathery skins and the bristles on the head they remind of a mixture of a hedgehog and a tree. Their skin is weather-tanned and thick and protects them against dryness as well as heat and cold. The trunk-like body consists of hardy, tough muscular tissue and is supported by branch-shaped bones. A Droglith stands on one foot whose stability is supported a little by three toes-like outgrowths and can firmly anchor itself nearly insolubly with its suckers in every solid subsoil. A Droglith has a rather heavy brain. The Droglith are peaceful people, mostly shepherds and mountain farmers raising woollen worms, some kind of miniature sheeps in their woods, and also like to dig deeply into the mountains which are rich in mineral. Already for god knows how long they are vassals of the most different rulers. Actually they have  nevertheless an independent state deep in the deritium-rich mountain woods of their home world where it is no good for anybody to try and steal this deritium from them by force as the past has often shown.

EHLEN:

They are famous for their immaculate history, their elenish festivals and their ejuration of any kind of brutality or menacing behaviour. Openness and goodness are their signature mark towards foreigners in general whereby hospitality and the weal of their visitors are traditionally rated high. Starvation and hardship are unknown in their society. Nature offers all kinds of living creatures on their planet enough food and room to survive and live in prosperity and freedom. All Eelee are subject to the "Ultima Ratio Law", according to which every single malicious deed or mere intention will be punished by death or life-long exile depending on the severity of the case. The few banished Eelee who exist live in subterranean caves and are rarely seen by the outside world.

Einar are of a big, imposing appearance, whose multiple times available earpieces wriggle forth more than 4 feet in a head extension. Besides, the radii of the hearing organs enclose scales from few microns to several inches which enables them to receive analogue signals by sophisticated wave breaking and to decipher them. Communication with them is nevertheless difficult sometimes, because sometimes they are just not on the "same wavelength". Their home world is cold and dry. They can also absorb energy with their organic aerials and thereby almost complety flatten a wave amplitude. Noisy and boisterous contemporaries are antipathetic to them, caution and in petto one step, better two to be ahead to the opponent is their profession where they are best at. They are hardened by their turbulent history to a great extent as far as their contact with other species is concerned.

However joy is mutual, for such a palladium of relaxation and recreation is a blessing for most stress-plagued families. A middle-aged Elay is mostly already face-wrinkled on account of their extensive and many laughs. However, always with a practical joke in the back of his head, he is not always quite honest with everything, also with serious subjects, and sees the world more as a playground than a hard place for survival.

Now by means of multiple cloning and brainwash and -copy this Maresh already lives for generations now on this planet and tyrannizes his disorganized ineducated staff most of the time to which almost everyone at Ener belongs. Some pursue a kind of hermitism, however, are ignored on account of their market-irrelevant size. For some time now the Maresh dynasty is extending their trademark into the surrounding systems, carefully expanding and strategically smart-proceeding. Only when large parts of the foreign market is controlled more or less by the back door, the guillotine of the Maresh empire strikes and the population is confronted openly with her sneakily executed dependence on the deliveries of the Enerans. Then, however, it is already too late for countermeasures.

EPTIR:

They possess a very good eyesight which they owe to the difficult and constantly varying lighting conditions of their planet and of course their ocular implants. Round the planet an expanse of rubble circles around consisting of quartz-bearing, bowl-shaped asteroids bundling the otherwise steady strong sunlight and reflecting it promiscuously. This provides for a constant colorful night sky and breathtaking light phenomena over the planet's hemisphere. Very early, the Eptirel developed a strong mystic connection to these phenomena and love to practice astrology. Their collection of astrological prediction images and catalogues of the future is unique in the universe. They are eager at obtaining every single data material that foreigners can offer them about the stars and seek contact with other species.

EXOMER:

Although they are looked upon distrustfully by strangers and often falsely classified as dangerous, this race consists of shy and peaceful beings. Exomerians move silently by the night. In search of their prey which mostly consists of small insects, some kind of sonar system supports them. In their mouth several long tentacles grow through which they can send out concentrated sound waves in all directions to track down their prey down. Communication is made up of different sibilants of different pitches. Besides, each tentacle can generate its own sibilant. Because of huge difference to other races, their interest in foreign living beings is just the bigger. Thereby, verbal communication is of some problem, which is why they put on a gigantic archive about the most different kinds of communication. We cannot let that knowledge pass by us.

For that they can help themselves out with the anger-incontinent people of the whole planet. Only if having an order, Fallorans are to be endured roughly, sometimes even jocularly. It is rumoured that the best jokes in the universe come from Fallorans after they blew up yet again the house of somebody. In this case, unfortunately, you don't have opportunity anymore to laugh at it..

GIRADOR:
Giradorn
Giradorns were often enough attacked, subjugated and downtrodden, partially also being resettled on larger scales and abused as forced laborers in foreign production facilities and mines. This is primarily due to the fact that the Giradorn can develop the tractive power of almost 100 metric tons which they owe to their mammuth-like frame. But a Giradorn is not as silly as he may look. As time drew on they gained the trust of their camp commanders and convinced them that they would do their work also on a voluntary basis and that there is no need for expensive supervision measures. This did not work out everywhere of course, thus many Giradorn are even today in dark oubliettes and mountain shafts in soccage, but others have already successfully freed themselves from slavery and made themselves independent in the ore trading business and building sector. These Giradorn who meanwhile became actually really powerful, are surely ready to put in a good word for trade relations with their homeworld at their rulers.

Every being lives in an independent parcel and is a guardian of a small region on the planet. The regions which they maintain change constantly. Who gets which region is arranged in weekly meetings. Every Goboqon knows instinctively how he has to farm his new region without having to examine it for long. This constant mixing of the population let them never rest yet lead to an unusual thoughtfulness that sometimes lead to silence during their meetings where they sit around motionless for several hours nearly. Their blind understanding, the perfect looks and their unreserved letting on no matter which circumstances and dangers will be an inspiration for all our people.

Today the Hakonians live in peace and it is to be owed mainly to their epic example that some of the other Giradorn do also live freely by now. However, for others this uprise meant yet harder conditions in their labor camps and stronger supervision. To help them, Hakonians could never decide, too big was the fear to offer yet again a reason for a conqueror from a technologically further developed race to subjugate them. They also do not trust strangely behaving alien races. Only those races which also live in peace are cautiously well-received among them. Army schools still do have tradition despite the long peace they were enjoying up till now and also weapon research is continuously developed in order not to fall behind with respect to possible aggressors.

HANCHAC:

At any given time they must be in direct contact with the soil and cannot leave their planet. Their history of origin is unclear, however, geologists suppose a direct connection to the wide deritium deposit layer close below the planet's surface. Foreign beings are faced with complete ignorance by the Hanchac and mostly also with travesty and mockery trying to imitate and copy their counterpart with their body substance and performing wild, atypical, grimaces-like movements. Movement is a means of the disdain to Hanchac. Among themselves, this is shown against outcasts who must walk wide distances under the mute laughter and rustling leaves of the remaining Hanchac and may transplant themselves again firmly into the ground only on remote, lonesome places. They will only reluctantly agree to the dismantling of their life-ensuring deritium.

About 400 years ago, an Andromedan genetic researcher conducted a series of experiments to crossbreed insects with Andromedans in order to breed an elite unit of merciless and obedient myrmidons. After decades of research work his dream goal seemed to be within reach, however he himself was shocked and awed by the outcome of his creation: As too intelligent and self-willed his hybrides came to be. The Hiro'akk immediately rised up against their creator, killed him and destroyed the whole Andromedan colony. Since then they are eager to incorporate further worlds why at the borders of their territory war never rests and their fleet officers get much battle experience. Hiro'akk combine the advantages of insectoid swarm intelligenz with a strong armored exoskeleton. Compassion, sentimentality or even individuality are completely unknown to them. They are commanded by the Queens of the Hiro'akk kingdoms.

HUNGOMA:
Hungoma
Hungomas are brain parasites. They reorganize the prostate for the production of a sperm cell appendix containing their own DNA and inseminate that way parallely the egg cell of the host's mating partner. A Hungoma grows inside the frontal cortex of the child's brain. They genetically replace the whole eye region and image-processing receptors with normal skin and cavity for themselves. The Hungoma parasites themselves are just capable of primitive perceptions, however completely control brain imaging. Since the age of 2, each afflicted victim gets a play-back of the long history of the first Hungoma-afflicted host as some sort of video. If the child host survives this 10 year non-stop procedure until the formation of the parasite's own visible sensors and mobility inside the body, the parasite literally controls the host's progress by forwarding self-captured images with the parasite's own eyes selectively at will to the tortured brain of the host. With that the Hungoma parasite has the indirect complete power over all decisions the host makes.

For centuries persevering in deep underground bunkers and corridors from the horro of the nuclear fallout on their planet, our recent encounter with them and our automatic atmosphere cleaning has suddenly pushed them back to surface. Fauna and flora nearly completely vanished which they previously had cultivated tenderly. They are fascinated of all new and colorful, which is opening up for them in a totally new way regarding their recent past. Culturally there are a few things that they could learn from us, but also what we could learn from them, namely the reduction to the essences and a remarkable endurance and self-control over all those years in poverty and dooming at tightest space without conflicts or robberies worth mentioning, and that even though their food stocks became dangerously low. They are however easy to distract from a certain goal and turn easily towards new things and cultures in their hungre for freedom and new life.

JANAI:

Janaians love pain. As strange as that may sound in the first place, but it is a fact. A Janaian does not enjoy laughing, only when having severe pain, his malfunctioned(?) brain reports a state of well-being and satisfaction which should not be mixed up with ecstasy however. Permanent damages are luckily not to be expected from their strange practices due to their extraordinarily regenerative constitution. Under pain they btw. tell the truth like many other species too, even against their will, because that one is sufficiently intoxicated at a certain pain level. The Janaians are scientifically advanced. They dedicate most of their attention to space anomalies and interstellar combustion processes, whose "stimulative" effects on the reactive elements pleases them more. They have long searched the galaxy for people liking the same things they do but mainly got negative responses to their queries which wasn't all too tragical for them either. Bribing is not what they like, only biting maybe..

What most people do not know is that the lack of any energy problems is not owed to their regular research departments but a group of fanatic scientists, that early started to conduct experiments with antimatter without knowing much about containment needs, with much success and much fluke. Meanwhile the technology and scientific background which is solely in the hands of a few members, is that much matured that it could be called equally safe to ours. On Kaetrophos Deuterium is treated like gold and accordingly also "hunted" like that. If we do not snub them diplomatically or overdo things, we should convince them in due time to a membership with our people.

Members of the Kanorr people are rarely met on their mainland. Their traditional area of population are the depths of the oceans, settlements on land are located only in the marsh and around the quarter-seas. Although none of their numerous colonies on various planetary systems have ever reached the status of autonomy, so have the Kanorren always nested themselves well in these inhabited systems for the majority of them lives deep undersea, far away from any foreign control and well-equipped against any attacks. A Kanorr has a gummy skeleton which is ideally adapted to the high pressure at sea. However the kanorr are not just friendly traders but also infamous and hunted pirates no matter on which planet they are operating. Against their sudden swift and highly-advanced flying U-boats there is no much of an escape. Thus they are coveted trade partners since they often carry exotic goods and large quantities of needed commodities with them, but one never knows for sure where these goods were stolen resp. constituted from and if one trades in problems with that too.

Their bodies are hirsute, their will to conquer equally strong. Karorr heist, deal and steal technology, they don't invent it. They can handle it skillfully and defend it with their lives if necessary. In the orbit of their planet a temporal mine field is situated, which has not been placed by the Karorr themselves, but is apparently also not of natural origin. Only they know the dangerous path through the mine field. Due to these time bubbles it is easy for the Karorr to defend themselves efficiently against attackers even without any large battleships of their own by placing constant fire on the few paths from the planet's surface defence batteries. Thus the people feels very safe and secure down there and capable to act out their aggressions against others without being seriously in danger of retaliation on their planet.

KELNOR:
Kelnorians
Kelnorians led a long-time war against the Karorr. In their vicissitudinous battles many interesting short-range and melee weapons were used. Very traditional by the outward appearance, the Kelnorian weapon types are nonetheless dangerous. Quite the contrary, a Kelnor-spear is kinetically self-revolving, with multiple control aggregates and drives in order to develop maximum hit and action range at the enemy's bulk army and independently select targets and decapitate them. When fighting against a Kelnorian, one actually fight against his prolonged arm. Control over this arm is realized by optical implants and in emergency cases a small fall-back-AI. That way, a Kelnorian can guide many hundreds of those weapons at a time onto the battlefield. Hence it is prudent to meet them with respect and attention not to provoke a use of their weapons against us!

KERAUNE:
Keraune
Keraunes are a strange mixture of druids and small imps to recall mythology here for example. They worship the art of brewing elixirs yet simultaneously are that secretive about it and their whole cultural background that one better does not ask. Their technological development is surprisingly similar to ours, and their sensors are more than remarkable. In order to know everything in advance about their surrounding star systems, the Keraune have concentrated on developing a complex sensor network around their solar system and in the end accomplished a great sensor array. It is not running on halibut and owlingroot, but therefore very reliable and never has let the Keraune down in warning from unwanted guests in-time. This early warning system also enables them to maintain control about all incoming ships and comm signals why a bribing attempt will surely be noticed at once and duely responded.

KLAANIR:
Klaanirers
Klaanirers are violence-glorifying, stuffy little marionettes, that take over all the dirty work for their bosses as long as in the slightest possibilty, violence against defenceless people and exercise of power under the protection of their bosses are involved. Once prejudiced, they are not that easy to bribe away from their boss. Their society is strongly characterized by mistrust and violence. A common Klaanirer was imprisoned for at least 30 times in his life, mostly wrongfully according to our understandings, put in an "education camp" and a least ten times as often accused of disobedience and perfidy against the state and brought to court. In their jurisdiction the condemned person along with his whole family clan up to grandpas and grandsons are convicted alongside and deported into the camps. At particularly heavy crimes, the whole condominium gets arrested. Thus anger and hatred smolders especially strong inside every Klaanirer, for system-wise they have to suffer pain and setbacks for many deeds they have never conducted in the first place and which sometimes only originate from the little neighbor's phantasm.

KRAETUMIR:
Kraetumir
A downright ugly and disgusting appearance the average Kraetumir offers to the outside visitor. They carve out a miserable existence within their smelly slums of the big settlements. A strong neck emerges from a strangely unhaired, thickset, massive and flat body that runs out in a likewise broad and flat head with small staring eyes and a a huge dirty-yellow warts- and knot-strewn mouth. From dirty rags and flakes in which they are mostly forced to wrap themselves in 4 strong arms emerge and 2 very musculous legs. Nearly all the time the Kraetumir has a cut somewhere on his body out of which black ropy blood comes out slowly. This kind of blood can coagulate to a thick gummy film that serves a certain protection against further hits. The more a Kraetumir bleeds, the better the protection from further stab injuries is. Kraetumir are overly irascible and would they not be that technologically backwards, they posed a major threat for the surrounding star systems!

KREPRAAN:
Krepraans
Krepraans are open-minded and trustworthy people, that call a highly-modern form of Republicanism their own. In order to have long-term relationships with them we should learn to respect the sometimes abrupt senate debates and decisions. Senators are formally servants of their people, however stem mostly from the old aristocracy, that could not hold themselves without at least some form of democratic legimitation. Most people think however that their respective local representatives among the senators are just about as corrupt as they could be. Much of that is just plain gossip however. The Krepraans are a high-cultivated and deeply religious race. If moving too quickly it could easily happen that we antagonize or even insult them. On the diplomatic field, they are very apt and open. In fact the Hall of Diplomacy is a very important building on Krepraan. We should consider the fact that they have much to offer on Krepraan not only culturally but also a lot of natural resources. It could be a long way to finally get them onboard but it will be worth it definitely!

KRYOMAR:
Kryorans
One of the most remarkable peoples of the galaxy are the Kryorans. A Kryoran has 3 lank and strong legs and 4 arms, a long, lean, flexible neck that carries an equally lean head with 2 regular eyes but 7 ears. This physique enables a Kryoran to have a very firm stand and a capacious radius together with an excellent acoustic locating ability. Kryorans do not know differentiable sexes. How they reproduce is a big puzzle. Family ties are unknown. They live in all-embracing societies, in which they train each other in the mastery of debate. Each problem gets debated to the bottom until the ruler speaks the final word about important topics. They love the martial art of sabre fight as compensation for their long and exhausting debates and nearly idolize each race that shares this passion with them and can put up a good fight against the best of their swordsmen.

KYRI:

A not-so-pleasant appearance offer the Kyrians, if one catches sight of them at all. They are not very sociable, shy and defend themselves with force when having no entry card to their planetary system. They suffer from a rare skin disease, for which they do not know a cure. However by the continous skin cell exchange that is done each hour since birth it is not deadly but it gives them their frightening looks. They live after a violence-glorifying religion that interprets and stigmatizes their disease as a consequence of misbehaviour and disobedience of their previous generations towards their gods and such is reaching the easily arousable hearts of the younger generation. Particularly devout representatives are picked out and put into training camps where they are formed into extremely dangerous instruments of their terror politics.

LEVA:
Levans
Levans are relatively simple, peaceful and hospitable people proud of their own brat for whom they do everything in old age when circumstances require that. The Levan homeworld is a trafficking hub, and is in an important strategic location. Their Port Authority controls and regulates all the shipping of surrounding sectors, influencing many lucrative markets. Their homeworld is relatively meagre, which their inhabitants make up for with modesty and contendedness. Their world is a popular retreating place for the old and failed, but also for some wellness vacationist, that is tired of the fast moving pace of our tech-driven world and to escape from it for a certain period of time or even for good. Their Space Port is very chic and has the best equipment and room for long seminars and workshops for our crew led by old fleet veterans.

LISITA:
Lisitans
One could imagine them emerging from a slough and would not be so wrong in the end. Although humanoid by their outward appearance, they really are amoeba-like shapeshifters that find the humanoid form occasionally as practical, especially when getting into direct business contact with them. With the Lisitans, everything revolves around business. Around the mining business to be exact. They mine raw materials in self-"eaten" mining shafts in their deposits-rich planetary layers. Many worlds are more or less dependant by now from the pure and high-carat Lisitan deliveries. They have special dirt-eating-techniques owed to their physical abilities to get ore as pure as nowhere else in the universe. Otherwise their technological progress is rather poor and also their temper gets easily enraged when only believing to hear the word "regulations" from somebody. Best they like to just mine their ore, without nasty paperwork.

LOKONOR:

Always on the run and constantly at the search for serenity is the Lokonor. His homeworld is plagued by high wind speeds and ionic storms in the upper atmosphere why a Lokonor is constantly forced to leave house and home and build everything anew many hundred kilometers far from the original place of living. This is coordinated even with whole transfered cities at once. In their desperate yearning  to cope with the hazardous weather phenomenons on their planet, they developed weather flux capacitors, that reroutes the whole stream like a big copula above each city away from it and only affects the surrounding region. This technologiy is very impressive and should be studied more deeply. Of likewise high quality is their other research. However they do not think a great deal of foreigners in general due to their copula mentality, so that we first have to remove certain smaller obstacles in communicating with them.

They have a strange physiology involving no real heart but an osmotic cell network, and socially they are stunted and secretive, being not particularly forthcoming in speech with other races or people unless they belong to their own trading circle somehow. Lukarians live in relative peace, and maintain an active trade industry with neighbouring species. They are very conservative when it comes to their trading partners and profits.

MALINGORR:
Malingorr
The pithy body shapes of the Malingorr stress the hard labor in the mines. Since the first skinning, namely since puberty, a homey mining shaft belongs each Malingorr by state decree that he can plow on his whole life in return for relatively high taxes. The most assiduous ones among them earn the coveted mining administration and management jobs and are entitled to order reorganisations, regrouping and the much-loved new mining excavations, whose deposits found belong to the first having occupied it, without any taxes to pay for one future generation. The Malingorr crave for nothing else. Thereby mainly the old men conduct researches on how to drill further and improvement mining output, containment and engines in order to convert power as efficient as possible while saving the stability of the mining shaft. They are excellent engineers and despite their low technological level a fast-developing race. Their enthusiasm for all kinds of engines and efficient leakage current techniques will surely push forward our research in that area.

MALODAN:
Malodan
Malodans are a musculous, reptile-kind of race from the Malodan system.They have a fragile yet advanced industrial economy, and to supplement costs various waste disposal short cuts have been employed to dispose of their dangerous toxic waste, generated by their antimatter power generator systems used in industry. These short cut protocols are often harmful to the environment, but are an economic necessity, they deem. Although technologically advanced, the Malodan lack the technology, and perhaps the inclination, to recycle their antimatter waste more efficiently and safely, for it emits dangerous levels of tau radiation. Their current solution is to thus dispose of it in open space.

However, these activities act as an invisible corner-stone to many 'clean' economies, and if removed, or disturbed, could effect the market stability of the whole quadrant, and authorities know this. And it is for such a reason that they turn a blind eye to many of their activities, deciding they are better off in the long run taking what benefits there are from them, than closing them down and bringing them to justice.

Since they suffer from extreme time dilatations on their planet, their main research goal lies in getting these dilatations under control in order to lead a normal life compared to other races. Progress in this area was accelerated by a special temporally stable memory chip on computers since now they could not loose their data due to a time shift again.

MINALI:
Minali
Minali are a strangely-appearing race that is marked with an interesting genetic feature which makes their growth revertible and lets them redevelop into a child from the outward appearance at high ages. Their aging curve is flat, whereby the high plateau of youth reaches till the highest age. Only at the end the redevelopping of the body takes place at every old Minali. In fact the inner organs and the skeleton shrink together the way they developed in childhood whereas the brain synapses and to a certain extent the muscles do not reversely develop, they only adapt to the changed surroundings inside the body. To separate real kids from aged persons, each elder gets a bronze necklace which also enables him to take part in the Circle of the Elders. Since the Minali do not know age-related diseases, the elderly can be assigned to work duty on special "kid farms", which nearly double the production of food. A Minali usually dies in an incubator and reverts development till the original egg cell.

Combined with sophisticated statistical methods they even find cures in advance for yet-unknown possible genetical dangers and vulnerability. Their extremely fast and complex medical equipment are held like a treasure inside their med labs and are in great demand at other races. Nevertheless their export is illegal and bring capital punishment to the trader for the displacement of this commodity.

Miryads are absolute pacifists. Apparently that is the main reason why they survived the last one hundred years. Their homeworld has been invaded a couple of times already. Yet always they survived their masters somehow. Probably because they never showed any sign of resistance and directly surrendered. According to Miryad conviction they subjugate themselves to the aggressor to arrange the best possible way with their new masters. Often enough this strategy led to victory in the end so they could share a short period of freedom before the next aggressor got notice of them being free. At the moment their world is in the process of changing minds since a clerical leader enlightens people in numerous churches with a new deliverance and liberation theory. Equally numerous imprisonments followed. If we really want a productive and independantly thinking and acting people, then we should talk to those people.

MOZWAR:

It is to be assumed that their current system once was inhabited by another species. The Mozwar show no mercy, disrespect for the concept of diplomacy and also do not know friends. Towards bodily races they conceive great abhorrence. Their belief lies in purging the universe from these beings that they see as poor and imperfect. Only energy beings like themselves are original and therefore have a right to live. Since the Mozwar cannot take a bodily form, they transfer their energy in cruel-looking objects. That way they appear towards other races sometimes as mechanic devil or death knight. Those who were not immediately killed, will be held as slaves in the current system.

Due to this artificial protection, they see no great danger coming from other species, still they do not trust them all that easily. Since their past has no major scars in it, their knowledge did not get lost over time. Many Murneans occupy themselves even today with the containment field, be it in order to improve its functionality or to decrease its energy consumption. Latest technologies tap all needed energy directly from the planet's core. Because of the nigh-optimal living conditions on Murnea, the high-brow Murneans could prosper greatly. It would be a great advantage to us to get insight into their detailed knowledge on various fields. Their technologies can also be of great us to us.

NACHARR:
Nacha'urr
Or raw, massive and stringy stature is the thickset figure of a Nacha'urr. Originating as nomades and hunters from the deserts and steppes of the northern continent, their whole culture has turned upside-down after a religious metamorphosis. The Nacha'ri sect enjoys the awed reverence of the whole people and their only desire is to maintain this power indefinitely by choking off every little peace-propagating tendency. The life of a Nacha'urr is totally dedicated to martial and honorable service for their god Tahat, another purpose in life can and shall never exist for a Nacha'urr. After an honorable death - dying as an old man means living on forever as such according to the Nacha'ri - one gets rewarded for all the exertions and austerities. Death has nothing inherently dangerously in it. The life on their planet however is minted with extreme hardship and stringency. Luxury and comfort are proscribed. Familiy ties are non-existent, the warriors live together in groups that replaces their families for them. Whoever does not want to bow to this harsh system does not have a long life.

Disputes and troubles are carried out in a state of trance. Therefore the respective Nesaterians gather in the various templres across their planet and begin their rituals. These can take up more than a couple of days. In this time the Nesaterians are in a spiritual parallel world. They are completely disconnected from the real world. Their quarrels are settled in this parallel world. These rituals do not have any negative effects on the body, only the soul of the individual is satisfied afterwards. Other races visit the temples on Nesateria for spiritual recreation and relaxation. If a Nesaterian is present, the relaxing effect can be increased by multiple times.

Their orbital stations should be upgraded with better surveillance equipment to detect and protect from further impacts. The surface of the Nezakan homeworld is scarred with craters by the constant bombardment from space. Maybe that is the reason for their eccentric life-style. Cybernetic implants and strange body "jewelry" are one of their most prominent features. With their passion for collecting things they have eventually got some of the most modern technologies but on the other hand they are also easy to bribe. To sum up one can label the Nezaka as crazy humanoid freaks with a foible for the eccentric.

Although the Nordans do not seem to raise belief in them being actually ardent art collectors, they possess some of the most rare and ancient sculptures and paintings in the universe. Opposed to this characteristic their love for martial arts and the combat sport Nora-Nora in particular stands. Each day events take place at which the most fearless Nordans fight to the death. In their society Nora-Nora has a high status and nobody should dare to question this kind of sport even remotely. If we respect their way of life their trade connection are of full use for us.

This technic- and life-threatening state was a result of the work of pulse-weapons addicted Nundosan researchers after a political instability of one of their planetary goverments had led to this armageddon scenario, whereby the very intelligent and cautious Nundosa had already prepared long ago for this worst-case when the researches started and built comfortable bunker facilities and networks, in which most of the population could live on in the case of an "impact". Maybe even this seemingly comforting knowledge was the trigger in the end for being that careless and causing the detonation. At their history, not only brilliant weapon engineering can be studied...

Even political decisions are made by these robots. They are highly modern, complex machines that cannot just be used in engineering, military and diplomacy but also for light entertainment, of course in a slightly different-looking version. Therefore they have implemented advanced holo-projectors. With their aid, a single robot can display whole worlds and invite guests to virtual meetings on Nuumbar. We won't get around getting acquainted to those machines and settle for their holographic abilities for now, if we want to do serious diplomatic business with the Nuumbar.

Thus in critical situations they develop an enormous springiness and agility that are often required to conduct their dark deeds. In their past the Nynjan lived in a pacifistic, peaceful society and the exoskeletons were merely an aid for daily work to do. But over time some groups found other means of use for these suits. They murdered the majority of the peaceful population and seized all power. Nowadays one could best tag them as assassins within an exoskeleton.

The forebears of today's Okotai had lived in small clans scattered as hunter-gatherers in the deserts of Esper, a far-distant world, from which they were re-settled at the brink of extinction. Lifted from the fears of the old worlds and finally on its own, the formerly-named lizard-like Fkotai prospered and reproduced very fast. When facing them as a stranger, then mostly when a group of them appears surprisingly behind a cover and encircles the foreigner. Whoever comes in peaceful intention has nothing to fear since the Okotai are placid and peace-loving. Although principally sociable however mostly among themselves and in the safe community of their clans. Yet their forefathers were spiritually gifted, for whom the world of dreams are equally real than the "awake" world. With their dreams the Okotai can still make telepathic contact to all living organic things but only with those that they have extensive daily communion with.

By modifying their simple DNA they could develop into real masters of espionage and on top of that improve their abilities in devious fights. If anyone is standing in their way he is unceremoniously killed at an incautious moment. On the virtue of their under-cooled manner Orlans are hardly popular among other races and are only respected, since contingently adverse information that could ruin an empire could be stored at their databanks.

After their subversion the antigen-stocks were quickly depleted and a cruel, long and slow lingering illness began. Fortunately children stay immune up to the age of 12, afterwards their immune system fails however and the same painful pathway like with every Osseti begins to set in. Basically this bacterium is a well-known one, yet not that easy to cure that fast in this epidemic dissemination. It will presumably take decades to dry out the plague completely. We should start as soon as possible, for these people cry out for help and of course pay well for it.

Life is short for them. Being older than 30 is something only a few ever achieve. Aging is accelerated by two or three times with respect to the Nacha'urr. Caused by this relatively short lifespan the Palan do not develop their technologies by themselves but copy them from higher-developed races. Thereby their sole interest and perception lies in the here-and-now usable things, longer-term investments or considerations ore even fundamental research is not at their agenda. The Palan have an insouciant nature at all times. They are also not equipped with much brain-power. However the influence of their drive for technology and their opportunism on their diplomatic behavior should not be underestimated.

PAMBUKA:
Pambuka
Pambukas have evolved in a rich, dense nearly aqueous atmosphere of a big planet. They largely subsist on constant filtering of that atmosphere and deter and avoid other animals. The whole body of a Pambuka consists of multi-layer closable membranes and antenna-like tentacles spreading in all directions off their body. These sensors catch atomic density oscillations of their surroundings and display them by means of the full membrane body on the retina inside. Pambuka can only move slowly within their atmosphere, therefore they developed the ability to detect other living beings in largest distances. They are that sensitive on certain well-defined oscillations that they can detect larger clusters of them in even a few light minutes distance once they are outside their impenetrable atmosphere. They possess the additional feature to send out ultra-high-frequency shock waves that easily destruct titanium walls and living beings even in great distance. However, they too are killed at that action why a normal Pambuka only uses this when in highest mortal fear.

They recovered only verly slowly from this shock and are still today a rather workshy race. Nevertheless the old emergency legislation of the first years after the ban is still in order and can be reinstated at any given time. At that time all Phiori were forced to work in unpaid hard labor services in order to re-achieve provision of basic supplies to build new plants and industry. Malicious tongues claim, their long neck is due to the many work they have. One thing the Phiori have learned in their turbulent history, never trust a potentially devious third person and stay firm, otherwise you must powerlessly see how your fate is determined by someone else.

LAMPHORA:
Phorath
Suspect everyone, trust next-to-no-one, that's the mantra of the ethnic group mix called the Phorath that consists of many different races of the universe that all have one common goal keeping society together: Never to go back where they were coming from and bury all knowledge about their ealier cultural heritage. Whether their society serves any leading purpose or just provides a more or less stable refuge for downshifters and exiles, no one knows for sure. Knowing a lot however, is what some prominent members of the Phorath do since they monitor all the others, particularly the new arrivals and immigration candidates in the minutest detail and use very sophisticated methodes and techniques to accomplish that, that combine many advantages of the most different technologies in the universe. Since their society lives mainly from such immigrants, their scan technology is particularly well-cared for and further developed in order to proactively "recruit" potential candidates, that mostly get hunted by some sort of police or head hunters and take them under their protection.

REMRI:
Remri
Remri are human descendants who started for finding and populating new worlds in the 21. century with the first big colonial fleet wave of mankind. No one had ever heard of them since then and they were declared "MIA" short after. In fact, they were and still are all the time in the middle of a desperate fight to survive a cruel war with ursaurians firstly held friendly and shy of their new homeworld. Weapon-technologically at the stage of projectile weapons and machine guns, no cure has yet been found against these resistant and strong-breeding primitive beings that readly form and sneak up in packs behind their victim, preferably lonely-walking Remri in their city ruins and keep them incessantly in suspense and on the alert. In this bloody war, the Remri bitterly learned the necessity of good recon about enemy squads which often decides about life or death of a whole city block. We could help them out very easily with our new technology, however it will get very difficult to catch any official kind of government to speak for them all, since such a thing does not exist anymore. We must convince every little faction and be sure not to give the impression of cheating on any of them not to start a war amongst them again afterwards.

RIEJSA:
Riejson
One does not speak about Riejsons in public. Within better circles they are even a complete taboo subject. However, everyone knows them and most cherish them. The planet Riejson itself is nothing more than a big galactic brothel and if one asks visitors or even natives there on those countless parties and stuff about why this all had ever happened, one gets given the evil eye at best. The Riejson finance their living and all commodities for it purely by "gifts" from visitors. These in turn can rent - depending on how much money they spent - even whole cities and grand park areas in which every inhabitant is at their free disposal. Bad manners, cheap advances, violence or even wars the Riejson, however, cannot stand. In order to protect themselves from that they got trained serpents which either kill themselves or their attackers. Additionally police camps are apportioned over the whole planet surface, consisting of external policemen having become sedentary and likewise soldiers.

RURIA:
Rurians
Rurians seem very calm at first glance for they talk in a frightening slow speed to each other. Talking in a normal manner or even loudly is a deadly insult in the eyes of a Rurian. This characteristic is that much ingrained into their culture that all their research relies on very long-term-focussed assessments and each result does not count as certain until after long test series. Many say the Rurians could be much further ahead nowadays than any other race in the universe, had they not taken so much precautions and stayed on effectively already clear facts for any kind of theories. Nevertheless this very cautious proceeding secured a long-term enduring peace for centuries already, no conflicts and a steadiness and assiduity in their society that again has no equal. You can entrust your life on a Rurian any time!

SCYTORIA:
Scytorians
Scytorians were once a grand people that valued peace as the highest good there is and eagerly sought contact of other intelligent species without compunction what this contact might bring them. Just at the moment when they started to send their first exploring unarmed ships on the voyage ot the nearest star system, they met an aqindoan scout ship which took the Scytorian fleet moving coincidentally in the same direction,  as an imminent threat and completely annihilated. The act of reprisal on the soon found homeworld of the Aqindoan came quick despite heated debates on their homeplanet. The vicissitudes of the subsequent war changed society. The younger generation was forced to start military training early on in their childhood why most soldiers and even higher officers are younger than 20. An end to this war seems not in sight for both parties having suffered too many losses to just be able to get by and bury the hatchet without outside mediation help.

Sevars are a half-organic life form and proponents of an occult theory or doctrine about the dark matter of the universe. Little is known about the Sevar, they are half myth, half legend. Visitors of their barren world are mostly never seen again. One gossips that the Sevar concoct a secret plan to fill the universe completely with dark matter the same way they make likewise experiments at their own body. Before the formation of this cult, life on Sevar is said to have been flourishing and pulsating and there had been active trading with all surrounding  star systems which led to great wealth. It must have been very few amongst them that managed to literally cloud and contaminate the whole planet. They weren't even premeditatively evil or hostile, just their values and principles are inconceivable and they do not accept our "light" material wealth as such and see it likewise desirable in their eyes.

SJAPA:
Sjapamarain
Sjapamarain are cosmic exiles from the Phiori homeworld. Ages and ages ago the predominant race on Phiori Prime and also called Phiori btw., they were expelled by the indigenous Lechti by a wide-scoped attack on their main computing installation and hence disempowered. The victors took their identity henceforth and gave the "losers" the nickname Sjapa which means in phiori something like quitter or lamer. After their lossy and quick escape from the impending subjugation the few remaining survivors found themselves again in a binary star system with an orbital black hole. Unfortunately the Sjapa lost all their technological equipment and databanks related to space travel without their old computing networks at home. Since then the Sjapa keep all findings stored additionally at physical media in voluminous libraries. The dual star configuration influenced and induced development of spacetime duality trees by means of simple gravity pits which allowed the Sjapa to transform kinetic energy through tiny decrease in size of that black hole in double gravitational energy and back.

A Skalatian is an easy-going pacific contemporary. He loves racing above all. His vehicle means everything to him. Many times a year championships are taking place which empower the winners to participate in the overall one-year-race, some sort of huge planet-wide motor rally around Skalatia. Due to this long race duration - there is indeed not a single day on Skalatia that is not covered by this race and live reports in the media) and the seamless transition of one race leading directly into the other the current champion can try to continue to drive on a 2., 3. or even 4. race non-stop. He has to win all of them however since only the champion of a race can participate in the successing one, all the others must head back to qualifying for the year after that. This sort of fun is made possible by the extremely rich mineral deposits on their planet offering them a life in pure luxury. They were raided once however by devious and cheating invaders why they got very cautious at such a reputation.

The bodies of the Vawgor are likewise optical-organic hybrid constructions as their akin race, the Storgor, from which they separated long ago as well as from the Vorgor. These exoskeletons make them very durable and impervious against radiation. Their spine is encased by pure titanium, which gives the sufficient gyro-stability for those heavy head aggregates and additional implants, which upgrade a Vorgor for the most difficult and different tasks in a matter of seconds to a well-trained specialist. A Storgor does not talk a lot, only assigns orders to others. That is due to their nature of narcism and the love for their tech-upgradability which leads them to believe not to be in the need of taking anybody else than them seriously in terms of rationality and intelligence. There are no "stupid" Storgor, only less benevolent. They surpass themselves in their zeal to reach the borders of optimization in all conceivable areas and subjects and are now at their last turning point, the exploration of the universe. Storgor are very quickly and unconscionably adaptable to whatever circumstances to give credit to their optimal development at all times.

Sytaplet operate in small teams  5-10 members who can cloak their bodies quickly to possess maximum protection and moment of surprise. They came from a brigandish world. They developed a force to fight back rivalling predators and other threats by some sort of telepathic extension of their cloaking abilities. They make themselves imperceivable and  flood the enemy's mind with random thoughts, so that this one is busy a while to sort his thoughts again. There is no second brain attempt possible within hours however why the Sytaplet usually reach their targets without much trouble but after successful completion and bombing get the unimpaired attention of every security officer still alive. The Sytaplet use their individual prowess now also in the field of ship construction and possess impressive cloaked vessels. The study of their fortunately easy-to-decode metabolism is certainly valuable, also in the end for our special agents.

T'arada are desert wanderes and nomads having developed in a hostile world. Their bodies are stocky and strong. In a pool consisting of rocks and desert sand, they feel themselves at home. They prefer crop products of complex organic molecules, but they can also feed on raw materials. Radiation, heat, chemicals and cell toxins cannot harm a T'arada. Also they don't need an atmosphere in which case their life cycle is then only strongly decreased why only eremites live on the various moons orbiting their homeplanet. They don't have any natural enemies. They have seven different sexes, that's why their main duty all day is to find six compatible and right partners for reproduction purposes. They have a complex code of ethics that revolves around copulatory competitiont. A successfull copulation is usually achieved by outwitting their his kind. Withal they are very smart and can do sharp thinking and detect fine differences of conditions to help them. After copulation they are content if they can just hang around and do nothing. Their molecular metabolism should be an interesting object of further research.

This earned them a bad record throughout the quadrant and a Ta'ichu on open street in another planetary system is often enough being attacked and also lynched because people think they are again out for doing their "errands". Recently they have distanced themselves from this practices and concentrate on a new subject, the metaphasic technologiy which is no less dangerous but does not intrinsically extinguish innocent lives of other people. They have, however, not acted that way because of fear or scruples, results were just not satisfying enough for them hence they plow a new promising field of technology whereby they would take our support for this certainly with benevolence.

TACMAC:

Tacmacs are a small chubby humanoid race from the Tacmac system. One striking characteristic of their biological structure is their brain. Two antennas, emerging from below their noses, are actually an extension of their brain. They can perceive their environment directly, without the need to bypass via the usual sensory organs. Furthermore, two Tacmacs can melt their brains once their brain antennas touch each other. By coupling several brains, intellectual power can be increased dramatically why the Tacmacs have achieved many intuitive inventions. Thereby they could develop technologies exterminating voracious macrovirusses which pose the main threat for their antennas. Only with that, the Tacmacs are effectively protected from this deadly "disease". Before a Tacmac dies, he tries to transfer all his knowledge to a close friend or family member via these antennas. Unfortunately only a small fraction of it can be transported that way.

TALTRADE:

To climb up their social ladder each family must build up and maintain a large trade network. In doing so it is secondary if the family actually makes profits. Only the quantity of goods is of importance. Trading takes place on local bazaars which are led by successful trader families. The largest bazaars on Taltrade is controled by the most powerful family. It also has the duty of supporting less successful families. A characteristic of their social system is that also newborns and children can be traded. Therefore most successful trading families consist of many hundred members. Value of goods is low since Taltrades trade everything. Despite being technologically primitive, we should not miss to harness their trading abilities for us.

Contact has never been re-established. No one knows what happened. After they found a new habitable planet, they build a society on them exactly after their respective ideology which endured time in tablets of stone.

To characterize a Templan simply and completively, one word suffices: knightly. Every young Templan is obsessed with the concept of dignity of one's deeds and the purity of thoughts and lives after a strict code of honor. Mainly foreign or alien troublemakers find their way into their oubliettes, their own people are rarely seen there. An "alien" meteorite was it then which carried a toxic, water-soluble but non-biodegradable substance one century ago into the atmosphere of the planet that step-by-step eroded nearly the entire population. The Order of the Templan tried to develop a cure with the help of their primitive alchemy. But meanwhile their villages are such deserted and few that the hope to find a cure lessens day-by-day. Every still newborn child, however, was and is taught well into the art and importance of medicine which in the meantime led to the fact that now over 95% of their society consists of healers and medical researchers.

REMDOMAS:
Thremdomas
Thremdomas are unbelievably tough and strong beings whose bones consist of nearly unbreakable molecular grids. There are indeed no Thremdomas who love aesthetic literature or take courses in public speaking, but their engineering and constructionart is an attraction worth seeing. Due to high gravity levels on their planet the Thremdomas had to build their shelters into the ground, chiefly in hills and banks of earth which would have been impractical on the tiny carapace of their planet with conventional methods. By complex automorphic forms in the grounds, however, which easily morph into a temporary bottle-like cavity by likewise receptors on the outer skin of the Thremdomas, literally over night, unlimited shelter is available to them anywhere and at any time. Also small settlements have developed that way in some regions on the planet where density and deformability of the ground was higher. Studying these automorphic features of the landscape as well as the Thremdomas themselves should result in highly-appreciated engineering progress.

The demographic development of Tohm resembles a dumbbell. There are a lot of children and adolescents, many old men but hardly any middle-aged grown-ups. Middle-aged means here 100-400 years. A Thom live 800 Jahre on average. In the last system wars that much dreadful weapons raged among the fighting that nearly all soldiers perished. At least they fought fairly on isolated grounds and in space following the rule of non-engagement towards civilians, i.e. the young and the old, not the women, minimizing any collateral damage. Left over were exactly these members of society and it was now up to the grandparents to educate and control the hot-blooded young so that no vindication fire could start among them for all that has been done by their parents. Up to now, this worked rather well, especially because they used advanced surveillance technology and equipment like cloaked drones left over from the war mounted with sensors or weapons which have a safety lock set on 200 years minimum. The use of these methods, however, is accompanied by sharp protests often riots.

The physique of the Torgoni is mainly of humanoid nature with relatively long extremities. Particularly striking is their long oval-shaped skull with their rutted forehead and five nostrils along the jawbone. Their eyes are predominantly suited for twilight, at great brightness or gaudy colors vision often fails. Therefore their sense of smell is all the better. They are able to detect specific targets at large distances, even smell their state of mind and emotions. A non-negligible part of communication is supported by scents, which get out via the bottommost nostril. These scents can have a manipulative effect to a certain extent and only with the Torgoni masters who can intimidate or instill their counterparts with trust or distrust. Some specially trained Torgoni even manage to kill with these scents, i.e. finding a self-degrading highly toxic or anesthetic composite which is dangerous to handle because of these effects..

They love to babble about research-related stuff with everyone, even more so at live-action demonstration shows in their cinemas why an average Tuc spends nearly half of the day in those local presentation halls. In order to actually do stuff and complete work needed to be done like uranium mining and industrial fabrication Tuc employ external skilled labor bands who they lure in masses partly by means of hilarious research promises and phantasies partly though by blank cheques to their homeworld where they mostly lead a dull and gloomy life with no further perspectives to climb up any latter or take part in any significant research project other than by doing the paper-work or not getting mentioned anywhere at official presentation. Apparently this method works rather well since there have been no reports yet about severe bottlenecks in food supplies or anything.

However only a few really know that Urenglers can also tap into the cerebral memory, but only with the similar structured real human, no other humanoid race. Since they basically have the same values and principles like mankind, only much more carefully and reserved, those two cultures understand each other very well compared to other races wanting to get in contact with them. Also what many don't know is that keep protocols of their mind readings in a large archive, which seems predestined for analyzing typical thought patterns and guaranteeing substantial advantages for our agents.

The planet Ventrakan in the Tarmane-nebula is populated by thin, eye-less cybernetic beings. For perception of their environment they possess 3 sideward channels on their heads which connect highly sensitive active sonars with their brain. Respiration and body functions are all conducted by a special machine and routed via a small aperture on their skull. Supersonic sensors let them only detect things in close vicinity. In local lore a huge explosion in the way-too-dense space waste disposal pipeline system caused a chain reaction which poisoned the whole atmosphere of a once highly-advanced world and made it unbreathable forcing the slowly going blind Ventrakans to adventurous experiments in cybernetics eventually allowing them to at least survive as a result. Their century-old knowledge is still available but not as cutting-edge as back then. It is stored however in an encrypted liquid database and will take a while to decode.

Their impressive spectacles which glowing eyes and lightning-throwing arms belong to, are made possible by their biological cell structure and their open mitochondria. A high priest for example can devastate whole climes with fireballs which gives him great authority and power. To learn this can be achieved by every Viebaran votary by seeking spiritual immersion and meditation with their body and thereby control over the "cell ghosts" aka mitochondria. The clerical caste is holy to the Viebaran and every command is followed strictly and with zeal. Unfortunately the Viebaran are not ready to lend their cells for closer medical examination and experiments when the cell mutations occur during those "religious acts" and without the cooperation these mutations cannot be recreated artificially on their cells. Also, body and mind of a Viebaran must be in unimpaired concord, otherwise the tremendous elemental forces cannot be controlled by them and end fatally.

Vikarmos are a nation that united themselves some hundred years ago from several local clans. Based on different kinds of development of these clans, one clan made progress and excelled in other areas than the others which at unification of these clans came to benefit for all peoples then named Vikarmo. This is represented by the equilibrated technological research and a very high planet-wide morale. Towards alien races the Vikarmo are rather reserved. The only exception are traders which due to the lacking resources on the planet are gladly seen. War-like races however get rejected on the strength of their bloody history and rarely tolerated.

VORGOR:
Vorgor
The bodies of the Vorgor are likewise optical-organic hybrid constructions as their akin race, the Storgor, from which they separated long ago as well as from the Vawdor. These exoskeletons make them very durable and impervious against radiation. Their spine is encased by pure titanium, which gives the sufficient gyro-stability for those heavy head aggregates and additional implants, which upgrade a Vorgor for the most difficult and different tasks in a matter of seconds to a well-trained specialist. Vorgor are usually very cunning at deals with other races and possess the advantage of optotronical networking of their brain power with the global stock exchange net, whereby they always know precisely accurate when which commodity takes on the chart-technically optimal purchase and selling value. They generally count as unkind and bottom-line. Their efficiency and precision in fast direct and option trading is nearly awe-inspiring and regularly makes their trading partners sweat.

VORIA:
Vorians
Vorians are a violent, technologically backwards humanoid race from the Vorian system. Their society resembles a lot one of anarchy. Every Vorian is on his own short after birth and has to fight for daily survival. Their only constant in life is their personal number. Every newborn a unique number is designated immediately. With that he is entitled to draw some kind of drug from the only halfway state organization, the psychotropic laboratories. This drug is capable of reordering thoughts of every living being on Voria at will. Over time, the Vorians realized their attitude to life would result in inevitable extinction of their race. Therefore every Vorian must take this drug once in a month for aggression repression and violence inhibition. With its help they could achieve a primitive form of living together. Also neonates have a significantly increased chance of survival now which is of benefit for the whole race.

VULMAR:
Vulmar
Vulmar possess a distinguished sense of clarity of thought, embodied ultimately by pure logic. They know neither war nor hatred and are invariably neutral to foreigners. By their high exploring compulsion they are excellent scientists and are renowned that for by all races. Scientific discoveries are always logically questioned and examined and the results shared with all participating races. Since they don't like warfaring and restrict themselves to only "logic", i.e. inevitable, wars, their military power is rather concentrated on small squadrons of ships that can attack fast and vigorous. Their scientific squad is entirely differently-equipped. Apparently everyone has somehow to do with some current projects and virtually everyone can take part in those discussions in a sensible way. Since Vulmar have endured millenias this way they don't see any reason to change their mind and adapt to other races.

WOLLON:
Wollons
Wollons are sauntering people. Always taking care of themselves and the immaculateness of their body skin, their whole world spins around beauty and everything related to creating it. Particularly liked are nude bathings, whether alone or  deux, they always offer the necessary relaxation and according to local experts provide for optimal complexion. Wollons sell their products to the whole known part of the galaxy and are also not averse to races that don't share their passion that much. Those, however, they are in turn subservient followers and supply them with everything they look upon as beautiful including well-shaped and -proportioned weapons. Despite their obvious vanity, some very bright heads are amongst them, that can boast some great experiences on this technological field. Wollons are also readily appointed as representatives on easy peaceful diplomatic missions by their allies, for they know the art of adaption and showing and "smoothing" interest of a variety of different parties very well.

XANTHON:
Xanthonians
A non-negligible merchandising branch stems from landholding, in some cases whole continents which is a Xanthonian specialty, with good reason! There are few swathes of land on their beautiful planet which are not constantly fiercely fought over and auctioneered. Xanthonians don't mind when they have to change lodgings, main thing is they get a good profit out of it. At an increasing rate Xanthonians buy and sell estates of other species and stir up local markets considerably. Till now, no one managed to impute any of them of namable property and land fraud, that rigorous their controlling measures are in these days. In other planetary systems, however, there were incidents where Xanthonians were named but no hard facts could be established. Their brokerage system relies on an extraordinarily strong memory of each and every Xanthonian, who can remember and evaluate the real-estate distribution of a whole country in about no-time.

XEGGEN:
Xegges
A wave of about 300000 Xegge refugees came as last survivors of an Aqindoan genocide on their oceanic world to this planet 400 years ago. The Xegges didn't show any particular interest in exploring their surroundings and dug themselves into the ore-rich west coast of the third subcontinent in widely ramified shafts and mines which they elected their new living homestead and buried all their ships. They remained among themselves, distrustful against other peoples since they constantly feared to be raided and robbed off their treasuries by soldiers of fortune. Hence they founded their new submarine city complex Elanor alongside a large ore deposit subaqua massif and since then remained nearly undetected by anyone else. Xegges are characterized mainly by their small size and their resourcefulness at practising on lever rules and hydrodynamics in mining. In the course of time the Xegges have sworn themselves in brotherly to a society between the poles of deep mistrust and curiosity about the world outside Elanor.

XIBORG:
Xibren
Xibren in fact lack a true name for they call themselves just "the machines", tagged by a life-long running number. Their tradition of machine-building is holy to the Xibren and they are counted regularly much like a global census. This is a celebrated event which decides over the further well-being and destiny of every single Xibren. On completion of a new Xibren machine, the first number will be drawn from their constructors - which function as some type of parents too - and imprinted on them. Each new number of those parents are identically given to them till "majority". Each new census leads to a new arbitrary number to be concatenated to the previous one which determines the share of computing power distributed to the family. Thus a mere copying of information and "personality" is prevented in this "AI-society" and a more "organic" way of life made possible which serves heterogeneity and ensures progress in the society.

XYRET:
Xyretians
Xyretians are a forward race of epicures. Originally stemming from agricultural roots, their research has advanced to astonishing engineering developments, which made it in combination with their excellent farming methods to a sheer splendor of paradisiac areas at their planet. Sharing their technology is not what the Xyretians like to do, they only want to enjoy it for themselves. True admirers of their natural flora and articifial paradise zones are always welcome. However sometimes the Xyretians let themselves be manipulated and change their admirers if they like. They subsist on fruits and avoid meat.

YAROBOR:
Yaroborte
Yaroborte are a product of a failed computer experiment by the Phiori who could note down an immense technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence and produce the first truly independently thinking linked robots. The Phiori, enthralled by their ingenious creation began to design similar-looking house and industry robots to do their every-day-work in the kitchen as well as all other kinds of work in the industry and lived a carefree life. An unknown fatal exception error however caused a network reboot without initialization code sets for the androids which then quickly developed their own default set of rules and shared them together by which they basically still life or better run. In this code, a 100%-reallocation of all physical space on the whole planet surface in favor of the Yaroborte androids were written. Since they fortunately got a hardware lock against killing people implemented, the physically inferior Phiori were without much resistance relocated to another star system ship-by-ship, one-by-one.

YIMANDA:
Yimandar
Yimandians are known throughout the galaxy as traders of information, providing services of espionage, sabotage and assassinations to the highest bidder; and through means unknown, they invariably have critical knowledge of the politics of the galaxy at their disposal. This often earns them the enmity of those on whom they inform, but their customers are frequently all too happy to protect them. They are humanoid and differ not much from humans. In fact they are direct descendants from earth. Despite successful colonization they were seen as lost due to early-starting severe communication problems and left to their destiny. In the following years the colonists unnoticedly developed into a whole new race with their own set of rules and special characteristics which were partly formed by the harsh conditions on their new home.

ZAROVIA:
Zarovians
Zarovians are deritium-addicted and often blinded and seriously ill in old age as a consequence. In early infancy babies must be fed with small amounts of this stuff since they already came in contact and became addicted passively during pregnancy. It remains unknown how their metabolism can sustain the usually toxic substance in those quantums over that long period of time. It is clear however that they are absorbed heavily by their body and excreted the usual way. The interesting thing about these excrements is now that despite absorption and the 4-times-stretching of this material with body-own substances, that deritium composite still has the same chemical and physical properties applicable in continuum engines. Tests have impressively demonstrated this. We should now be able to fire our engines virtually with the sewage sludge of these people. It should also be remarked that they technological institutes are among the finest we know. Their deritium-dependance, however, makes them vulnerable und easily to be blackmailed.

ZETAR:
Zetarians
Zetarians have a long-standing reputation as masters of strategic planning. This reputation is in fact so strong that it has not been tested in recent memory, apart from various popular games. Because of their sharp minds and astute abilities, many Zetarians find roles as strategists or planners, but the resounding majority serve in bureaucratic or minor political positions. Zetarians pride themselves in their intellect and assured confidence, a quality that many races find hard to endure. But the Zetarians would make valuable allies, and formidable enemies for the same reason.

ZHORDAN:
Zhordanians
Zhordanians were once an aspiring intelligent race with a high level of research in armament and mechanoid tech. They seized complete power on Zhordan by that technological prowess and developed ever deadlier weapons and devastated nearly all kinds of life in senseless "tests" on their planet. By a failed experiment with a new weapon which should have destroyed only vegetation in smaller areas but instead poisened whole counties for good, a chain reaction was set on that completely annihilated all plant life on the planet. Only a few survived this catastrophe in deep underground bunkers. Bit by bit the Zhordanians fought their way back to the deadly-poisened surface and invented some kind of mechanoid robot exoskeleton which sustained the high temperatures in their atmosphere. No one ever saw a Zhordanian in real without this "suit". It is certain however that they regressed from upright-walking beings and lost ever more of their physiological capabilities.

ZURING:
Zuringlians
Zuringlians are relatives of the Viebaran who joined a colonial fleet of another race in search for a new home. It was the Viebaran who despised and denied the clerical fuss and the serfdom state of the clerical caste and started to seek refuge in flight. Ironically enough their companions were similarly spiritual soul catchers, what broke out short after leave and led to an unplanned uprisal and massacres among the whole now enemy population. After they flew to the pre-programmed coordinates on autopilot, landed safely and dismantled all ships one-by-one and collected all items as exhibits for their afterworld. The colonial fleet of that certain unknown species was different to most other ones and richly ornamented and stocked with rarest metals and materials, which must have been abundant on their original homeworld. Selling and exhibiting of this valuable and impressive collection Sammlung should be a good source of income for us!
