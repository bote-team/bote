The Matilda-class originally was an experimental prototype of more modern cruiser. Yet the ship did impress the engineers and crew members that much that it has been added to the fleet. Engines, weapons, armor as well as shields are extraordinarily good. It can take over all imaginable tasks. At present there is hardly any ship out there which is able to hold a candle to the Matilda-class. A disadvantage however are the high build costs.

AT-Class
Shortly after the foundation of the Coalition of Planets, it was decided to commission a new, revolutionary ship class. The result was a platform which enabled mankind to leave their star system and explore the universe. These ships are despite their relatively strong armament foremost research ships and that way their captains see it too why they are rather not a threat for a real combat vessel.

For this reason torpedo armament is especially distinct. As a sideline state-of-the-art defensive systems were integrated in this ship class. Enemy ships will have a hard time to pit themselves against a fleet of Pattons.

Longeyes are withal considerably more compact and durable than their predecessors which makes conducting scientific activities even under worst conditions possible.

The Duluth-class is the result of an ambitious development program of the Utopia Planitia fleet yards. The huge Duluth-class dwarves everything done before and was mainly designed to replace the aged Chilmark and Farscape classes at scientific missions. At drawing the concept of the Duluth-class the best engineers and technicians of the Coalition have worked together and created the doubtlessly most advanced ship in the fleet. Aside from its role on scientific assignments this ship type also is an excellent command ship to coordinate large fleet operations and withal a strong enemy.

Firefly
The Firefly-class is the "younger sister" of the Duluth-class though designed later on. She is considerably less expensive than their bigger collegue and was therefore ordered in larger numbers. Aside from that this ship class is also an excellent strike cruiser.

Wolf
The Wolf-class is replacing the not-so-old Benton-class. The prominent advantage of this ship are the relatively low production costs. Withal the ship offers excellent speed and maneuvrability in combat. Hardly any other ship can keep up with that. On the bad side are the relatively few offensive weapons.

Han'Quhr
The Han'Quhr is the flagship of the Heyoun Trade Union and therefore the most advanced and dangerous ship in the fleet. Earlier concerns about non-profitability of such monstrous and expensive ship classes were dismissed after several unfavorable battles against enemy large warships of this type and such this gorgeous ship was born. All ship systems, especially the weapon ones are state-of-the art the least.

The current version of the Vantor has dropped its transporter role and is now used for frontline patrol missions, as escort and for fast raids.

Glantor
Glantor-class transports are designed to follow combat vessels into enemy territory, carrying troops for ground invasion. Since these ships do not carry any ship-to-ship weapons, it is prudent to keep escorts attached to those ships.

Leviathan
One of the most deadly warships around, the Leviathan gets close to a starbase in terms of its huge armament and can take out many ships already with a single volley. High speed and good sensors contribute to its special dangerousness. The only weak spot - if it could be named so at all - are the shields, but therefore the Leviathan is extremely  strong armored.

Its role as troop transporter makes it very valuable for the Khaoron why it was equipped with a disruptor cannon to defend itself. However it does not necessarily protect the ship from any enemy ship or orbital battery, also because of the ship's low speed and weak shields.

C'lypeus
In his sedulous attempt to expand territorial borders, the Rotharian Star Network is continually colonizing new planets. Ships like the C'lypeus transport colonists and equipment to these worlds for terraforming and construction of a local infrastructure. Thereby the ship itself serves as source for building material once the planets are reached. Like all colony ships this model too is unarmed and terribly slow so that it is defenseless against attacks.

R'Acron
R'Acron cruisers are heavy assault ships that can fire devastating broadsides onto enemy ships or planetary bombardments with their disruptors and torpedos. Rotharian commanders indeed prefer tactics and finesse, but this ship could also stand a pure repartee with a respective enemy. Its relatively weak shields are compensated by good cloaking and a powerful engine. R'Acron-class cruisers were the backbone of the Rotharian Strike Force for a long time and enjoyed great popularity with their commanders.

C'nutrix
In his sedulous attempt to expand territorial borders, the Rotharian Star Network is continually colonizing new planets. Ships like the C'nutrix transport colonists and equipment to these worlds for terraforming and construction of a local infrastructure. Thereby the ship itself serves as source for building material once the planets are reached. Like all colony ships this model too is unarmed and terribly slow so that it is defenseless against attacks.

P'socodea
P'socodea-class scouts are extremely fast and very nimble ships that are perfect for covert reconaissance deep within enemy territory. Should they be detected once despite their excellent cloaking and caught by a warship, they could easily escape with maximum speed. Smaller enemies do not have a chance anyway against its impulse disruptors.

M'adomen-class fighters are utmost nimble ships that are best used in large squadrons where they can deliver terrible damage to the enemy. With their high speed, the impulse distruptors, the good cloak and relatively strong shields, such an attack formation can have devastating effects on every other fleet or even base that is surprised by it. Swarms of M'adomens encircle enemy cruisers and eliminate them by concentrated fire, while they themselves are hard to hit.

Its extreme speed and high maneuvrability in combination with its relatively strong impulse disruptors makes it a deadly opponent for other similar-sized ships. Aside from that the ship is perfect for quick raids deep in the enemy territory, whereby it is often deployed in small squadrons to surprise and destroy single larger ships or even outposts by their combined firepower.

Despite its low speed and only moderate firepower these ships are due to their maneuvrability and especially because of their cloaking device also well-usable for espionage missions and covert reconnaissance.

Withal it serves as escort ship and is also used to intercept enemy scouts, a task, where this ship excels at usually. A smart fleet admiral utilizes these ships to weaken enemy fleets before his main strike force engages in battle.

D'Ocellus
The D'Ocellus-class battle colossus is double the size of a Coalition Duluth-class cruiser with a slight advantage in firepower at comparable speeds and maneuvrability but weaker shields and sensors. This disadvantage is well-compensated however by its powerful cloak which gives even this colossus the chance to surprise and attack enemy ships that are stronger and better-shielded before they can raise their shields. An attacking squadron of D'Ocellus battleships that approaches under the cover of its cloak, can take out nearly every opponent including star bases and large fleets at first strike or at least heavily damage them.

This ship definitely marks a further highlight of Rotharian ship building and is well-liked among its crew.

Horath
The standard Hazetian cruiser is an example of overmotivated design for an originally intended update to its heavy destroyer predecessor which acted as a frame model for this ship. It is suffering from too many weapon mounts, slow maneuvrability and high costs.
