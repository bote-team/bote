Shortly after the foundation of the Coalition of Planets, it was decided to commission a new, revolutionary ship class. The result was a platform which enabled mankind to leave their star system and explore the universe. These ships are, despite their relatively strong armament, predominantly research ships and their captains can see that they are not a threat for a real combat vessel.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Agamemnon
The Agamemnon-class is a sheer monster among the ships of the Coalition of Planets. The ship is huge, armed to the teeth and equipped with high-power shields. The Agamemnon was designed as a pure warship. 

Firefly
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Barracuda
After introduction to the fleet the Barracuda-class definitely counts as one of the fastest ships of the Coalition. She has bioneural ship computer components and a variable geometric continuum field that is created by special continuum pylons. These ships are small but very agile and persistant.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Belvedere
The Belvedere-class is a highly modern spacecraft of the Coalion of Planets. It marks a step forward with respect to the outdated Peraine-class. She is a fast destroyer with high fire power. In addition the Belvedere-class features state-of-the-art regenerative shields.

Peraine
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Benton
The classification of the Benton-class is unknown. The ship is mainly a re-assemblation of Matilda-class components. It has armament and deflectors similar to the Peraine-class. Ships of the Benton-class are fast frigates which are mainly used to protect the Coalition borders.

AT

Cherumir
This improved colony ship class carries double the amount of colonists on board as the previous version and also possesses better equipment for terraforming.

Seraphine
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Chilmark
The Chilmark-class is the first true cruiser of the Coalition and the most powerful ship of the fleet. Its enormous size is a big advantage. Speed and maneuverability however suffer because of this.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Duluth
The Duluth-class is the result of an ambitious development program at the Utopia Planitia fleet yards. The huge Duluth-class dwarves everything done before and was mainly designed to replace the antiquated Chilmark and Farscape classes at scientific missions. When drawing the concept of the Duluth-class the best engineers and technicians of the Coalition have worked together and created the doubtlessly most advanced ship in the fleet. Aside from its role on scientific assignments this ship type also is an excellent command ship to coordinate large fleet operations and also is a strong enemy.

Chilmark
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Duluth II
At Duluth II class some improvements were done, inclusive an speeding up. So these ships are better able to do their tasks.

Duluth
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Farscape
Farscape-class explorers were brought into service as small, cheap research ships long ago. Since then they have proved themselves for long-range research missions and therefore are now equipped with weak armament.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Firefly
The Firefly-class is the little sister of the Duluth-class although it was designed later on. She is considerably less expensive than her big sister and was therefore ordered in larger numbers. Aside from that this ship class is also an excellent strike cruiser.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Fox
The standard Coalition transporter. Small, efficient, reliable and well-suited for most transport missions. Speed, shields and armor are not very strong in this type of ship class.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Hathaway
The Hathaway-class is a sister ship of the Peraine-class. This ship type is built for direct ship vs. ship combat. Speed and maneuvrability are excellent. The only downside of this class is the lack of torpedo bays.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Ignition
The Ignition-class is the direct successor of the Hathaway-class. The mistakes made with the old class have been eliminated completely with this new design. In battle, agility has been slightly decreased but  the offensive weaponry poses a major threat to any enemy vessel in range.

Hathaway
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Lamprey
This improved transporter can carry more troops and has better shields and better engines therefore it can be deployed more effectively in planetary invasions.

Fox
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Longeye
Shortly after having forced the Ultima One project, newly-designed components were integrated into the latest small ship class for practical testing purposes. Out of that the ultramodern recon scouts of the Longeye class was designed which from now on replaces the Mole-class. Longeyes are likewise considerably more compact and durable than their predecessors which makes conducting scientific activities even under worst conditions possible.

Mole
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Matilda
The Matilda-class originally was an experimental prototype of more modern cruisers. Yet the ship impressed the engineers and crew members so much that it has been added to the fleet. Engines, weapons, armor as well as shields are extraordinarily good. It can take over all imaginable tasks. At present there is hardly any ship out there which is able to hold a candle to the Matilda-class. One disadvantage however is the high build costs.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Mole
The Mole-class is the direct successor of the Farscape-class. Their main task is to explore alien worlds, far away from home territory. To this end, they are equipped with powerful engines. Armament and defensive systems can therefore be called rather weak.

Farscape
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Montgomery
The Montgomery-class is a bulky type of space ship that is equipped for scientific missions as well as small skirmishes. This class is with respect to engineering design a go-between of the AT- and Wolf-class.

Outposts serve as fleet supply and carrier stations. This type is a light version in terms of weaponry and sensors.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Outpost 3
Outposts serve as fleet supply and carrier stations. This type is a medium version.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Panslaight
The Panslaight-class is a modern cruiser of the Coalition. This class performs all standard orders and tasks. Its armament, speed and defensive systems are well-balanced. This cruiser can be produced cheaply and constitutes the backbone of the coalition fleet.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Patton
Pattons are heavily armed and very agile. The Patton class owes its existence to the increased efforts of the Coalition fleet to avert potential danger from large enemy vessels. For this reason torpedo armament is especially distinct. As a sideline state-of-the-art defensive systems were integrated in this ship class. Enemy ships will have a hard time pitting themselves against a fleet of Pattons.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Peraine
The Peraine-class is a reliable ship design in duty since the end of the 22nd century in modified design for tasks as supply ships for the Coalition fleet. A relatively cheap but efficient and fast-to-build design which can used for research operations as well as as border patrols, escort missions, battle aid and courier services.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Peregrine
Peregrine-fighters are small attack vessels with few personnel yet relatively strong armament. This class is often deployed in military conflicts between large fleets in order to scatter enemy fire on various fast-moving targets responsible for opening up enemy lines for larger destroyers to break through.

Ultima One
After the completion of the Ultima One project this ship type finally is available to the Coalition fleet. A special double hull design provides more stability. Fire power and durability have no equal. Only the best captains shall fly this ship. The majority of our fleet receives orders directly from these mighty command vessels.

Matilda
$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Valkyrie
In contrast to other ship classes of the Coalition, the Valkyrie-class was mainly designed to fight extremely strong enemy battle cruisers. Aside from conventional weapons the ship has impulse laser cannons and quantum torpedo bays. Maneuvrability in combat as well as excellent defensive systems have no equal with ships of this size.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
Wolf
The Wolf-class is replacing the not-so-old Benton-class. The prominent advantage of this ship is the relatively low production costs. Also the ship offers excellent speed and maneuvrability in combat. Hardly any other ship can keep up with that. On the bad side are the relatively few offensive weapons.

HanQuhr
The HanQuhr is the flagship of the Heyoun Trade Union and therefore the most advanced and dangerous ship in the fleet. Earlier concerns about the non-profitability of such monstrous and expensive ship classes were dismissed after several unfavorable battles against enemy large warships of this size and soon this gorgeous ship was born. All ship systems, especially the weapons are state-of-the art.

Leviathan
One of the most deadly warships around, the Leviathan gets close to a starbase in terms of its huge armament and can take out many ships with a single volley. High speed and good sensors contribute to its special dangerousness. The only weak spot - if it could be called that - is the shields, therefore the Leviathan is extremely  strong armored.

$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
D'Ocellus
The D'Ocellus-class battle colossus is double the size of a Coalition Duluth-class cruiser with a slight advantage in firepower at comparable speeds and maneuvrability but weaker shields and sensors. This disadvantage is well-compensated however by its powerful cloak which gives this colossus the chance to surprise and attack enemy ships that are even stronger and better-shielded before they can raise their shields. An attacking squadron of D'Ocellus battleships that approaches under the cover of its cloak, can take out nearly every opponent including star bases and large fleets at first strike or at least heavily damage them.


$END_OF_SHIPDATA$
M'adomen
M'adomen-class fighters are extremely nimble ships that are best used in large squadrons where they can deliver terrible damage to the enemy. With their high speed, impulse distruptors, a good cloak and relatively strong shields, such an attack formation can have devastating effects on other fleets or even bases that are surprised by it. Swarms of M'adomens encircle enemy cruisers and eliminate them with concentrated fire, while they themselves are hard to hit.
